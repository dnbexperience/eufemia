Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.

indent_inner_html (default false)  — indent <head> and <body> sections,\n    indent_size (default 4)          — indentation size,\n    indent_char (default space)      — character to indent with,\n    wrap_line_length (default 250)            -  maximum amount of characters per line (0 = disable)\n    brace_style (default \"collapse\") - \"collapse\" | \"expand\" | \"end-expand\" | \"none\"\n            put braces on the same line as control statements (default), or put braces on own line (Allman / ANSI style), or just put end braces on own line, or attempt to keep them where they are.\n    inline (defaults to inline tags) - list of tags to be considered inline tags\n    unformatted (defaults to inline tags) - list of tags, that shouldn't be reformatted\n    content_unformatted (defaults to [\"pre\", \"textarea\"] tags) - list of tags, whose content shouldn't be reformatted\n    indent_scripts (default normal)  - \"keep\"|\"separate\"|\"normal\"\n    preserve_newlines (default true) - whether existing line breaks before elements should be preserved\n                                        Only works before elements, not inside tags or for text.\n    max_preserve_newlines (default unlimited) - maximum number of line breaks to be preserved in one chunk\n    indent_handlebars (default false) - format and indent {{#foo}} and {{/foo}}\n    end_with_newline (false)          - end with a newline\n    extra_liners (default [head,body,/html]) -List of tags that should have an extra newline before them.\n\n    e.g.\n\n    style_html(html_source, {\n      'indent_inner_html':
