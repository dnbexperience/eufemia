# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in the @dnb/eufemia, please report it by sending an
email to [tobias.hoegh@dnb.no](mailto:tobias.hoegh@dnb.no).

This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a
bug report to the GitHub repository.

Thanks for helping out.
