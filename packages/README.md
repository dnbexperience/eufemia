# DNB **Eufemia** design system packages

In here we have several packages with different purposes. `@dnb/eufemia` is the package to build the NPM version of the ui components. `dnb-design-system-portal` is the main web site to show off both the **Design System Principles and rules** and the **@dnb/eufemia** components, styles and patterns.

There is also a repo with [examples projects](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia-examples) to run the components in different frameworks.
