## Description

The `InputMasked` component uses the DNB Eufemia normal input component, but with some additional masking functionality. Read more about the details [on the open source project](github.com/sanniassin/react-input-mask).

**TODO:** This is an experimental component and should be tested more before using it in production (e.g. DerivedStateFromProps, or that the "mask" prop uses a function or RegExp, so it has to be built in a special type of JSON parser).
