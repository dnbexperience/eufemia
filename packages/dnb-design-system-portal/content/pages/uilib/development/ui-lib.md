## How to publish a new version to NPM?

Make sure You use a correct **[message decoration](/uilib/development/commit)** to insure correct versioning.

You have to commit (or Pull Request merge) your changes to the `origin/develop` branch. Once Your commits gets approved by the CI Server, You can make a _Pull Request_ to the `origin/release`.

As soon as the _Pull Request_ gets merged into `origin/release`, the CI Server will check all commits and figure out the new NPM **Version Number** and publish a new version based on the message decorations.
