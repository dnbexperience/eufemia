# Import styles

In order to apply the Sbanken styles, you need to both define;

the CSS package:

```diff
import '@dnb/eufemia/style/core' // or /basis, when "dnb-core-style" is used
- import '@dnb/eufemia/style/themes/ui'
+ import '@dnb/eufemia/style/themes/sbanken'
```

and the Theme:

```jsx
import { Theme } from '@dnb/eufemia/shared'

render(
  <Theme name="sbanken">
    <App />
  </Theme>,
)
```

## Runtime theme swap

However, the above solution will not work for changing the theme in runtime.

Changing theme during runtime, without pre-loading all CSS styles and fonts together, requires a more sophisticated solution.

When using Gatsby, you can use this plugin [gatsby-plugin-eufemia-theme-handler](https://github.com/dnbexperience/gatsby-plugin-eufemia-theme-handler) to change theme during runtime.
