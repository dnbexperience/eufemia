# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## How to enable lint-staged?

Create a file called `.env.local` in the root of the repo (side-by-side to the .git folder), and put `LINT_STAGED=1` inside:

```bash
# File: .env.local
LINT_STAGED=1
```

## Dependency issues

## Babel

Due to this bug: https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/11394 we add `.png,.snap` so they not get copied: `--extensions '.js,.ts,.tsx,.png,.snap'`

### Yarn PnP

Currently, Eufemia uses yarn with `node_modules`.

When switching over to Yarn PnP, there are some issues:

- Storybook:
  ```bash
  ERROR in eufemia/.yarn/__virtual__/@dnb-eufemia-virtual-761b82657c/1/packages/dnb-eufemia/src/components/slider/style/dnb-range.scss (eufemia/.yarn/__virtual__/css-loader-virtual-37c5c374e4/0/cache/css-loader-npm-5.2.7-e1e8b8d16f-fb0742b30a.zip/node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js!eufemia/.yarn/__virtual__/sass-loader-virtual-577853f541/0/cache/sass-loader-npm-10.2.0-91ed64638b-d53212e5d1.zip/node_modules/sass-loader/dist/cjs.js!eufemia/.yarn/__virtual__/@dnb-eufemia-virtual-761b82657c/1/packages/dnb-eufemia/src/components/slider/style/dnb-range.scss)

  ```
- Gatsby
  ```bash
  gatsby-plugin-mdx tried to access mkdirp, but it isn't declared in its dependencies; this makes the require call ambiguous and unsound.
  ```

### Gatsby v4

In order to ensure `defaults and supports es6-module` is not targeting IE11, we run a newer version of `browserslist`.

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "gatsby/browserslist": "4.21.4"
  }
}
```

Gatsby v4 uses socket.io v3 that has an [issue](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/issues/3838) when running all visual tests in a batch locally on a development build. To mitigate it, we have installed a newer version of socket.io:

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "gatsby/socket.io": "4.6.1"
  }
}
```

### svg2vectordrawable

`svg2vectordrawable` uses an very old version of svgo that did not work with newer versions of Node.js.

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "svg2vectordrawable/svgo": "2.3.0"
  }
}
```

## MDX v2

In MDX v1 the Portal used an MDX template (`./templates/mdx.js`) with the `createPage` API. This is currently not the case anymore.
Instead, the "PortalLayout" is used to wrap `.mdx` pages inside the `wrapPageElement` API.
This is due to the `JavaScript heap out of memory` error when using templates.

## Visual tests and Playwright

Jest does start several works at the same time. When we simulate states on e.g. ToggleButton and Button – Playwright (v1.31.2) struggles to handle this. Some of the hover or focus tests will fail. To ensure Jest we never execute several workers as the same time, we set `--maxWorkers=1`.

### Installing screenshot browser

For running screenshot tests (visual tests), a headless Firefox browser is needed.

In normal circumstances, the browser will be installed automatically via yarn install – but to either upgrade to a newer version, or to wipe out existing versions and run the install manually, you can run this commands, depending on your needs:

```
yarn workspace @dnb/eufemia playwright uninstall --all
yarn workspace @dnb/eufemia add -D @playwright/test
yarn workspace @dnb/eufemia playwright install firefox

yarn workspace dnb-design-system-portal playwright uninstall --all
yarn workspace dnb-design-system-portal add -D @playwright/test
yarn workspace dnb-design-system-portal playwright install firefox
```

#### Alternative install: skip authentication

But, since Node.js and corporate proxy do not enjoy each other's company, this might
fail with a `Error: unable to get local issuer certificate`. In that case, your only
option might be to disable all authentication for this command.

```
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 yarn workspace @dnb/eufemia playwright install firefox
```

#### Alternative install: manually

Or, in the very worst case, you can manually download the zip file that `yarn workspace 
@dnb/eufemia playwright install firefox` attempts to download, and extract the file
("Nightly" for Firefox) to the folder indicated when `yarn test:screenshots` fails.

## How can I make faster builds?

This is only meant for "setup testing" purposes! In order to make faster local builds, you can:

- Inside `gatsby-config.js` rename all sourcing from `/docs` to `/docs_dummy`

Run `yarn workspace dnb-design-system-portal build:visual-test`

## I get Gatsby 404 Not Found on the pages I work on

- Try cleaning cache: `yarn workspace dnb-design-system-portal gatsby clean`
- Try running `yarn build` again
