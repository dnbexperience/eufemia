# New contributor

## Quick intro to the UI Library

If you are new to the Eufemia Library, we would recommend following an intro to the elementary parts of Eufemia.

## Your first contribution

First time contributing to an open-source project? You can learn how to commit your first Pull Request from the Github free series, [How to Make a Pull Request](https://makeapullrequest.com/).

The next step is finding an issue to work on. The [/contribute](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia/contribute) section of the repository on Github highlights beginner-friendly issues you can start with. If there is nothing to find at the moment, check out the [Jira issue board](https://jira.tech.dnb.no/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=EDS&rapidView=1221) for more tasks or ask one of [the maintainers](/contribute/contact).

## How to report an issue or suggest a new feature

You may use [this "reproduction" starter](!/issue) to reproduce the issue when reporting.

If you discover a **security issue** in the @dnb/eufemia, please report it by sending an
email to [tobias.hoegh@dnb.no](mailto:tobias.hoegh@dnb.no). This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a
bug report to the GitHub repository. Thanks for helping out.

New features and issues can be filed as a new issue in [Github Issues](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia/issues).

More information in [Style guides - Issue reporting](/contribute/style-guides/issue).

## How to submit a Pull Request

After you have committed your changes in a branch, you can go to [Github Pull Requests](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia/pulls) and open a new pull request.
In the pull request message, there will be a template that you fill out (including a summary of your changes and of the run tests). Request one of the maintainers as reviewers and submit your request.

More information in [Style guides - Git convention](/contribute/style-guides/git#pull-requests).

## What should I know before getting started

Have a look at the "before getting started" section for a description of technical details. In this section, you will find what packages are included, design decisions explained, the format of the component structure, what purpose different files have, what happens during a build, and the different development environments.

## What to expect from the maintainers

The maintainers are the project contributors responsible for driving the [Eufemia vision](/vision) forward and managing the organizational aspects of the project. These are the ones that will maintain the project, review pull requests, and answer questions regarding decisions in Eufemia.

As of this date, there are only a few maintainers. That means you can expect **longer response times** in periods. When contributing to Eufemia and becoming more familiar with the way of works, you will have the option of becoming an official maintainer. More contributors and more maintainers will help accelerate Eufemia and become up-to-date with fast response times, which will benefit all involved parts.

## Next step

<Blockquote className="dnb-blockquote--no-background">
  The best way to understand a project is to just jump on a real task. It
  is scary, but the easiest and quickest way of getting into a new project.
  Also, you should not be afraid of having an imperfect commit, that's
  really what pull requests are for!
