# (Optional) Update change logs

Changes to `@dnb/eufemia` have to be mentioned by using a [git commit messages decoration](/contribute/style-guides/git/#commit-messages). During the next release, the package `CHANGELOG.md` file will be updated and changes will get listed on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia/releases) page.

General Eufemia **Design System** changes have to be written down in the `EUFEMIA_CHANGELOG.md` file, located in the docs. This file should only be updated if there is a change in the `@dnb/eufemia` package, which affects the components, elements or extensions.
