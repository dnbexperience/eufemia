# Documentation

The documentation is written in enhanced Markdown, called MDX. It allows us to import other Markdown files along with React components and JavaScript logic.

## Handling themes

If you need to show some documentation only for when a certain theme is choose, you can do so:

```md
<FilterByTheme name="eiendom">

## Eiendom examples

Text

<SpecialExample />

</FilterByTheme>
```
