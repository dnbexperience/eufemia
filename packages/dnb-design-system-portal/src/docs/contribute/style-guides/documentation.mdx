# Documentation

The documentation is written in enhanced Markdown, called MDX. It allows us to import other Markdown files along with React components and JavaScript logic.

## Handling themes

If you need to show some documentation only for when a certain theme is selected, you can do so:

```md
<VisibilityByTheme visible="eiendom">

## Eiendom examples

Text

<SpecialExample />

</VisibilityByTheme>
```
