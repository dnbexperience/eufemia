# Documentation

The documentation is written in enhanced Markdown, called MDX. It allows us to import other Markdown files along with React components and JavaScript logic.

## Handling themes

If you need to show some documentation only for when a certain theme is selected, you can do so:

```md
<VisibilityByTheme visible="eiendom">

## Eiendom examples

Text

<SpecialExample />

</VisibilityByTheme>
```

### Link to a specific theme

You can add a parameter called `eufemia-theme` to a url:

```md
[Relative](/uilib/components/badge/demos/?eufemia-theme=sbanken)
Absolute: https://eufemia.dnb.no/uilib/components/badge/demos/?eufemia-theme=sbanken
```

It will change and set the current theme used theme once the user visits the related page.
