# Git convention

**Make sure you follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org)**

Version numbers are handled automatically by using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#readme).

## Commit Messages

For consistency, please write commit messages in the **imperative mood**.

A clear and concise commit message helps others understand the purpose of the commit and makes it easier to search through the history for specific changes.

### Why the Imperative Mood?

The imperative mood matches the implied "command" to the codebase. Think of the message as completing the phrase: _"This commit will..."_. For example:

- **"Fix bug"** (instead of "Fixed bug")
- **"Add feature"** (instead of "Added feature")
- **"Refactor code"** (instead of "Refactored code")

This convention helps maintain consistency and clarity across the Eufemia codebase.

### Decorate your commit messages

Make sure to **decorate** your commit messages with either [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) or [simple-commit-message](https://github.com/bahmutov/simple-commit-message):

- `fix: fix message` as the subject
- `feat: feature message` as the subject
- For a major change: `feat: message` + `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer of the commit. See example below.

If you are working on a single component update, you can use a decoration and a scope in parenthesis:

- `fix(ExampleComponent): an example fix message`
- `feat(ExampleComponent): this is a new feature`

You can also use the following decorators – but keep in mind, they won't be included in the [releases change log](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia/releases):

- `chore:`
- `docs:`
- `style:`
- `build:`
- `ci:`
- `refactor:`
- `perf:`
- `test:`

Example of a breaking change commit message:

```text
feat: commit subject with optional decorator

Body with text
Several lines

BREAKING CHANGE:

Subject (will be a list item):

Markdown text over several lines.

Additional text such as:

1. List item
2. List item
```

You can find more info in the [docs of semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#how-does-it-work) and [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

### Ignore CI run

You can either include `[skip ci]` in your [commit message](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-02-08-github-actions-skip-pull-request-and-push-workflows-with-skip-ci/) or let your branch name end with `--skip-ci`.

### Rebasing

#### Squash commits

If you have to make a small fix after you committed:

- Make and commit the new change
- Squash and rebase with the previous commit
- Force push to your branch

#### Rebase onto main

If you are working on a branch for a long period, it might be necessary to do a rebase on main once in a while:

```bash
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main
```

## Pull Requests

When you have committed changes to your branch, go to [Github Pull Requests](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia/pulls) and open a `New pull request`.

You will most likely get the yellow notification bar mentioning that a branch had a recent push. Click on the `Compare and pull request` button. This will take you to the page for opening a pull request. Fill out the template under the `Write tab`.

Request a reviewer, create the pull request and watch the results of the pipeline checks.
