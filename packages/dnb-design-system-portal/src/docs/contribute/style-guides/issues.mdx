# Issue reporting

If you discover a **security issue** in the `@dnb/eufemia` library, please report it by sending an
email to [tobias.hoegh@dnb.no](mailto:tobias.hoegh@dnb.no). This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a
bug report to the GitHub repository. Thanks for helping out.

When reporting issues or suggesting new features, we would appreciate if you use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia/issues) or our [Jira Kanban board](https://jira.tech.dnb.no/projects/EDS/summary#). Another option is to send a Slack message in [#eufemia-web](https://dnb-it.slack.com/archives/CMXABCHEY).

## GitHub issues

When reporting issues on GitHub, you need to have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

First step is to click on the `New issue` button in the `Issues tab` on GitHub.

The next step will show you all the possibilities for new issues. Create a new `Bug Report` or a `Feature Proposal` to go next.

These will each have a prepared template you need to fill out in order to submit your issue.

## Eufemia Version

**Browser:** Type `Eufemia.version` in your browser console.

**Node.js:** Use import or require to find out what Eufemia version is imported:

```js
// NB: Use "require" if needed
import { version } from '@dnb/eufemia/shared/Eufemia'
console.log('Eufemia version:', version)
```
