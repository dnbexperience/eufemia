## Basis information

The default DNB brand theme is called: `ui` which stands for _universal identity_.

## Main theming file

There is one **Main Theme File**, that includes all component themes, such as this one: `dnb-eufemia/src/style/themes/theme-ui/dnb-theme-ui.scss`

To include new or update imported component themes, run `yarn build`.

It will find all related themes and put it inside the main theme file so they can get compiled to one CSS bundle.

### Creating a new main theme

First, duplicate or create a new SCSS file inside:

- `dnb-eufemia/src/style/themes/theme-[YOUR-THEME]/dnb-theme-[YOUR-THEME].scss`

Do the same with every component you want to customize, and run `yarn build`. All the related component theme file will then be included in that main theme file.

During package build, a CSS bundle will be created.

### Run the Portal with a different theme

What theme gets imported is handled in the Gatsby Plugin `gatsby-plugin-eufemia-theme-handler`.

- Change the theme name in the Plugin options (`defaultTheme`).
- In the Portal Tools you can switch to a different theme.
- You can also define a different theme in the url itself `path/?dnb-theme=ui`.
- Create a new `/packages/dnb-design-system-portal/.env` file that includes e.g. `GATSBY_THEME_STYLE_DEV=eiendom` and start the portal with `$ yarn start`.

## Component theming

All components have a style separation of:

- _layout_ where positioning and raw shapes are defined.
- _skinning_ where colors and peculiarity are defined.

This way we can create more easily custom skinned themes.

### Button as an example

- All the raw _layout_ related CSS properties are in this one file `dnb-button.scss`.
- While the theme file `dnb-button-theme-ui.scss` contains colorization and font sizes (_skinning_).

```js
/button/style/dnb-button.scss // layout styles
/button/style/themes/dnb-button-theme-ui.scss // main theme styles
/button/style/themes/dnb-button-theme-eiendom.scss// additional theme styles
```

How `eiendom` is set up does not matter. It could either import parts from `ui` or be maintained independently.

### CSS custom properties and :root

Whenever possible use Eufemia Properties inside Eufemia components.

When defining custom properties for a component, **prefer** to put them inside the component scope:

```css
.dnb-button {
  --text-size: var(--font-size-medium);
}
```

In some circumstances, you may make them share-able and place them inside `:root`. They should then contain the component-name as a prefix.

## Local Theming setup

There are several solutions to **create a new theme**.
One of which is by using the [linking feature of Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/link/).

### yarn link and SASS

Make sure your project can handle **\*.scss** files.

**1.** make a copy of the [repository](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia). Place it somewhere locally on your machine

**2.** change your command line (Terminal) directory to the sub package `@dnb/eufemia` (_eufemia/packages/eufemia_)

**3.** make the package ready for development by running:

```bash
$ yarn install && yarn build && yarn link
```

**4.** on your application root directory, run:

```bash
$ yarn link "@dnb/eufemia"
```

**5.** That's it. Now you can use (import/require) the NPM module in your application like:

```js
import { Button } from 'dnb-eufemia/components'
import 'dnb-eufemia/style/components'

// See the "src" in the path?
import 'dnb-eufemia/src/style/themes/theme-ui/dnb-theme-[MY THEME].scss'
```

**6.** Don't forget to add `"@dnb/eufemia": "*"` with the respective version (alongside React) to your dependencies:

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@dnb/eufemia": "x",
    "react": "x",
    "react-dom": "x",
    ...
  }
```

## Chrome Extension: Eufemia Theme Manager

Use the [Chrome Browser Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eufemia-theme-manager/pijolaebmeacaekbhoefjmhogckdcclb) to:

- test themes on web applications
- create new possible themes
- look how the outcome would be if a theme would be used
- and create areas where a different or a modified theme would make more sense

You can also download the [Chrome Browser Extension (ZIP)](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia-theme-manager/raw/main/eufemia-theme-manager-extension/web-ext-artifacts/eufemia_theme_manager-latest.zip), and install it manually in your browser. To do so, go to `chrome://extensions` and drag & drop the downloaded ZIP file in the opened extensions tab.

Contributions are welcome. Heres the [source code](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia-theme-manager).
