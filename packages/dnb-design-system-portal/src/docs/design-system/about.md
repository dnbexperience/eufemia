# About Eufemia

## The Goal

Eufemia is [DNB's](https://www.dnb.no/) design system, which consist of resources for designers and developers in order to maintain consistency and efficiency when building accessible web applications.

The goal is to have a single source of truth for design through color, typography and layout guidelines as well as fully coded components to use in applications.

With Eufemia, DNB can continually increase the product quality for both visual users and users relying on assistive technologies.

### More aspects

- Accessibility
- Collaboration
- Original files
- Versioning / system thinking
- Extensions
- Overall documentation

### Standards

Eufemia follows the industry and regulatory standards [UU Tilsynet](https://www.uutilsynet.no/) alongside with [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).
