# About Eufemia

## The Goal

Eufemia is [DNB's](https://www.dnb.no/) design system, which consists of resources for designers and developers to maintain consistency and efficiency when building accessible web applications.

The goal is to have a single source of truth for design through color, typography, and layout guidelines as well as fully coded components to use in applications.

With Eufemia, DNB can continually increase the product quality for both visual users and users relying on assistive technologies.

### More aspects

- Accessibility
- Collaboration
- Original files
- Versioning / system thinking
- Extensions
- Overall documentation

### Standards

Eufemia follows the industry and regulatory standards [UU Tilsynet](https://www.uutilsynet.no/) alongside with [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

You can read more about what we at DNB UX expect and define as the minimal [accessibility requirements](/uilib/usage/accessibility) for our web applications.
