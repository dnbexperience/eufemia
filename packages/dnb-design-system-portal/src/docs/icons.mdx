- For web, icons are available as both [SVG files](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia/tree/main/packages/dnb-eufemia/assets/icons) and ready-to-use [React components](/icons/secondary#react-example-usage).
- For Android, there are [custom XML (drawable) packages](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia/tree/main/packages/dnb-eufemia/assets/icons/dnb/eufemia-icons-xml.tgz) and [categorized XML (drawable) packages](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia/tree/main/packages/dnb-eufemia/assets/icons/dnb/eufemia-icons-xml-categorized.tgz).
