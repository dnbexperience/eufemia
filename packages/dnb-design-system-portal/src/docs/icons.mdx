# Icons Library

This is a list of all icons available, sorted by categories. It's a combined list where primary and secondary icons are shown together. You may be interested to [read more](/icons/details) about [the differences](/icons/primary) and [how to import](/icons/secondary#react-example-usage) them.

- for Web there are both [icons as SVG](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia/tree/main/packages/dnb-eufemia/assets/icons) and ready to use [React Components](/icons/secondary#react-example-usage).
- for Android there is a [custom XML (drawable) package](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia/tree/main/packages/dnb-eufemia/assets/icons/dnb/eufemia-icons-xml.tgz) and a [categorized XML (drawable) package](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia/tree/main/packages/dnb-eufemia/assets/icons/dnb/eufemia-icons-xml-categorized.tgz).
- the support for iOS with the PDF format was discontinued in [v10](/uilib/about-the-lib/releases/eufemia/v10-info/).
