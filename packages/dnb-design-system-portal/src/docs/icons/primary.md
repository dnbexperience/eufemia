# Primary Icons

The Primary Icons used inside of Eufemia [components](/uilib/components) and also bundled as an [UMD Package](https://unpkg.com/dnb-ui-lib@latest/umd/dnb-ui-icons.min.js).

Primary Icons can easily be defined/included in components, for instance, in [Buttons](/uilib/components/button).
They are integrated by using the `<IconPrimary />` [Icon Component](/uilib/components/icon-primary).

## React example usage

```jsx
<Icon icon="bell" size="medium" />
<Button icon="chevron_right" />
```
