# Primary Icons

The Primary Icons are used inside Eufemia [components](/uilib/components) and are also bundled as a [UMD Package](https://unpkg.com/@dnb/eufemia@latest/umd/dnb-ui-icons.min.js).

Primary Icons can easily be defined and included in components, for instance, in [Buttons](/uilib/components/button).
They are integrated by using the [IconPrimary](/uilib/components/icon-primary) component.

## React example usage

```jsx
<IconPrimary icon="bell" size="medium" />
<Button icon="chevron_right" />
```

You can also import them like the [Secondary](/icons/secondary) icons:

```jsx
import { bell_medium, chevron_right } from '@dnb/eufemia/icons'

<Icon icon={bell_medium} size="medium" />
<Button icon={chevron_right} />
```
