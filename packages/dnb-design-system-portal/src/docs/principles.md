## Introduction

You will find two sets of principles in the DNB Design System and one set of values.

1.  Design System principles: this is a set of principles for users of the Design System.
1.  End user principles - the principles upon which we build DNB products and services for our users.
1.  Brand values - located in the Brand book.

### Design System Principles (Eufemia Principles)

1. Don't add bloat to the system at the same time do not let the system develop debt - old content no longer relevant.
1. The system and it's content should be self explanatory - easily picked up and understood by a new designer or developer, i.e not dependent on a single individual.
1. Add content to the system like it's your last day - add comments, clear succinct descriptions to code and design files.
1. Eliminate this question : "I'm new here - where do I find the...".
1. The work is never done - A system of guides can and should be continuously improved.
1. Focus more on communication than the tools of the trade - common language and understanding, frequent discussions, including of all stakeholders...
1. Stay agnostic - code, data and design file formats should remain as platform and application independent as possible.
1. Comply to the [living system](/uilib/getting-started/living-system) principles as well as the [maintainability](/uilib/getting-started/maintainability) principles.
1. Test Test Test - continually test the system with it's users to ensure it is relevant, usable and goal.

### End user Principles

1. Design for all - follow accessibility and usability guidelines for everything you make.
1. Start with users - gain insight, discover their needs, understand them.
1. Understand context - when, how, where, with which device etc.
1. Maintain consistency both visually and through re-application of design extensions.
1. Just enough interface. When in doubt, remove.
1. Design and code with performance highly prioritized.
1. Consistent experience across all platforms - small touch screens to large desktop displays.
1. Reuse, reduce and recycle. Harness the efficiency of reusing extensions and components.

### DNB Brand values

DNB Brand values are located on page 6 of the DNB Brand book. The values are built on these three foundations:

**Curiosity**, **Responsibility**, **Bravery**
