### Brand guidelines

What you should read from brand guidelines before starting to design for DNB

### Getting started

1. Open Figma
2. Make sure you are a member of the DNB UX team. If not, then contact a lead designer (https://eufemia.dnb.no/design-system/contact)
3. When you click on the 'You' dropdown, you should see DNB Bank ASA as a team to choose from.
4. Choose DNB Bank ASA <InlineImg src={FigmaTeam} caption="Join the DNB UX team" alt="Join the DNB UX team" />
5. Create a new file
6. Add Eufemia library to your file by selecting the 'open book' icon on the top right of the Figma interface. <InlineImg src={FigmaLibrary} caption="Figma's library icon" alt="Library icon" />
7. This opens a new dialogue window. Choose Eufemia by toggling the switch: <InlineImg src={FigmaLibraries} caption="Add the Eufemia library" alt="Add Eufemia team" />
8. In preferences set your nudge amount to 8px - this will snap items to the 8px grid
9. Add a layout grid and set it to 8px: <InlineImg src={FigmaLayoutGrid} caption="Add an 8px layout grid" alt="Add 8px layout grid" />
