## Accessibility checklist for designers

Building an accessible interface starts at the UX stage of design. Much of the DNB Design System's styling and development have taken accessibility into consideration to a certain extent (see [UI Library Accessibility](/uilib/usage/accessibility)). However, each interface design comes with its own challenges and requirement.

- [ ] **Content is perceivable**: Ensure good contrast between background and foreground.
- [ ] **Accessible for keyboard users**: Plan how you would like a keyboard navigator to access interface laments/areas. What will the order of tabbing be?
- [ ] **Skip to content**: Should you provide a ’skip to content’ feature to allow users to get to the main content quickly?
- [ ] **Responsive page**: Plan how the interface will respond to different screen sizes. The layout may have to change - how will this affect accessibility?
- [ ] **Zoom the interface**: Some users zoom their browser to increase the size. How will elements behave in these scenarios? Will they overlap? What happens to wide horizontal components such as navigation or tab sets?
- [ ] **Fluid design**: As opposed to using fixed breakpoints, fluid design allows the content to reflow in the same order as screen readers render content to users who are blind or visually impaired.
