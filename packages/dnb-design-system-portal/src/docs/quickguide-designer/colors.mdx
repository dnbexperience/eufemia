## Gradients, shadows, and shades

### Gradients

The DNB brand consists mainly of solid fill colors. Gradients should be avoided despite there being an illustration in Brandbook on page 39 (pdf) showing a graph with a purple gradient.

### Shadows

Shadows are used to depict depth along the z-axis. Typical use cases are interface components that are laid 'above' the main interface such as calendar widgets. Android development for DNB uses Google Material Design Guidelines regarding shadow color, depth, blur, etc.

See the DNB Figma main guide for shadow specifications.

### Tints and Shades

Tints are lighter versions of the color that are made by mixing a color with white, whereas shades are darker versions of the color that are made by mixing a color with black. If a lighter version of a primary color is required (due to accessibility, contrast, or for illustration), consult with the design team.

### Tertiary colors

Use a calculator [such as this](https://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html#fg=33FF33,bg=333333) [or this](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to test your text color and size against the background for contrast values.
