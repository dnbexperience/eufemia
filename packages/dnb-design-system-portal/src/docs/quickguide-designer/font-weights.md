## Font Weights

Achieved with HTML classes: `.dnb-typo-regular`, `.dnb-typo-medium`, `.dnb-typo-bold`

## Body Regular

**NB!** body text is automatically set to use **regular** (as for now also: _book_) weight so there is
no need to use a class.

    Here is a paragraph with some nonsense lipsum text. Contrary to
    popular belief, Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
    the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
    source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of
    "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and
    Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
