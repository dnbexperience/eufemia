# Tools

DNB's main (original) design templates and guides are created and maintained in Figma.
Designers are **encouraged** to work in Figma to maintain compatibility and shareability.

## Why not Sketch?

We are working on the 'single-source-of-truth' principle. For that reason, only one design application will be used to generate Eufemia's main documents.

In general, if a team decides **together** to use a specific application or technology because they feel that the product or service will be built better than they should, or that they are more comfortable using it. Even then it is recommended that data and file formats remain agnostic(?)/ reusable in other common applications/technologies.
