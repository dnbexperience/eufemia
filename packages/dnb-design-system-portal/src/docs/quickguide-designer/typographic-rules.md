## In General

The default font for all web applications is Fedra Sans Standard.

You will need to request use and download of the font due to licensing.

Make sure it is installed on your system so you can use the design resources.

## Typographic scale

The Eufemia typographic scale is as follows:

14px, 16px, 20px, 24px, 32px, 48px

NB! we use **ems** and **rems** for setting the size in code **not** pixels.

Line-heights vary depending on context but adhere to the Eufemia space units (multiples of 8 including halves (4px)).

## Typographic styling

Refer to the Figma style guides for styling typography with color.

## Margins & Padding

Blocks of text (headings and body etc.) do not have TOP, LEFT or RIGHT margins by default. This is usually set by the containing element and based on context. However, they do have a default BOTTOM margin of 1rem ( 16px ). This can be adjusted depending on context.

The reason for this is to provide an out-of-the-box style which looks good before any customising is applied.

Make sure to stick to the Eufemia spacing system when adding or removing bottom margins.

Padding is also not something applied to blocks of text by default.
