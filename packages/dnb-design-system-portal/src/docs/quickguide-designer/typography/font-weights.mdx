## Font Weights

Achieved with HTML classes: `.dnb-t__weight--regular`,`.dnb-t__weight--medium` or `.dnb-t__weight--bold`.

The old classes, `.dnb-typo-regular`, `.dnb-typo-medium` and `.dnb-typo-bold`, still work, but will also set font-family and font-style.

### Body Regular

**NB!** body text is automatically set to use **regular** weight so there is
no need to use a class.

    Here is a paragraph with some nonsense lipsum text. Contrary to popular
    belief, Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
    classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
    comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
    Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
