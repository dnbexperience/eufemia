- [How to Install](#install)
- More in the [Releases section on GitHub](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia/releases)

## Since last release info

- [Dropdown](/uilib/components/dropdown) got several new properties like `prevent_selection` (Popup Menu), `size` (small), `align_options` (right) and `more_menu`. For the `more_menu`, have a look at the Demos and also take a look on **Popup Menu**.
- [DatePicker](/uilib/components/date-picker) is now using v2 of `date-fns` and with this more east to translate to english (including new props `submit_button_text` and `cancel_button_text`), as Norwegian (`nb`) is the default `locale`. But also `align_picker` is a nice feature to have.
- Also mostly every "from" component now supports HTML `data-*` attributes in event returns.

## GlobalStatus

This component is made to be used for mainly three UX situations:

- Global application error messages
- User-generated error messages
- User input correction advices

The component has to be placed directly under a header bar (UX principles). From there it will expand / slide down once a message is appearing.

Every "form" component, like [Input](/uilib/components/dropdown) will automatically connect and update the [GlobalStatus](/uilib/components/global-status) once an error status is show to the form component:

```jsx
import { Input } from 'dnb-ui-lib/components'

// 1. Place it under the header bar
<GlobalStatus />

// 2. Else where in your app - input with error status
<Input label="My Input" status="Error message" />
```

But You can also manually update / show as many messages as You want:

```jsx
import { GlobalStatus } from 'dnb-ui-lib/components'

// 1. Place it under the header bar
<GlobalStatus />

// 2. Else where in you app and later on, you can show a message
<GlobalStatus.Add
  status_id="custom-id-1"
  title="New title"
  text="First long info text ..."
  item="Item from status #1"
/>

// 3. and remove it again when ever You want
<GlobalStatus.Remove status_id="custom-id-1" />
```
