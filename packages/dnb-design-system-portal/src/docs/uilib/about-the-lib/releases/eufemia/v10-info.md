## Migration

v10 of @dnb/eufemia contains _breaking changes_. As a migration process, you can simply search and replace:

### StepIndicator

1. Find the `active_item` property and replace it with `current_step`.
1. Find `use_navigation` and remove it or replace it with `mode="strict"` or `mode="loose"`.
1. URL support has been removed â€“ so props like `active_url`, `url`, `url_future`, and `url_passed` are not supported anymore. You have to handle it by yourself from inside your application.

## Install

To upgrade to @dnb/eufemia v10 with NPM, use:

```bash
$ npm i @dnb/eufemia@10
# or
$ yarn add @dnb/eufemia@10
```
