## How to migrate

v10 of [@dnb/eufemia](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dnb/eufemia) contains _breaking changes_. As a migration process from v9, you should follow all of the guides below.

## Install

To upgrade to @dnb/eufemia v10 with Yarn, run:

```bash
yarn workspace <your-workspace> add @dnb/eufemia@10
# or
yarn add @dnb/eufemia@10
```

## Deprecations

1. Helper class `.dnb-sr-only--inline` and SCSS mixin `srOnlyInline` was removed.
1. Helper class `.dnb-not-sr-only` and SCSS mixin `notSrOnly` was removed.
1. `import { SpacingHelper } from '@dnb/eufemia/shared'` was removed due to low usage. Use one of the [other exported helpers](/uilib/usage/layout/spacing).
1. Stylis plugin, `import stylisPlugin from '@dnb/eufemia/style/stylis'`, has been removed.

### TypeScript

1. Updated multiple types from `string | boolean` to `boolean`, as there was a lot of properties who should only support boolean values and not strings.
   Examples of changes to do would be to find Eufemia components using `"false"` or `"true"`, and replace it with boolean values. i.e., `vertical="false"` to `vertical={false}` or `selectall="true"` to `selectall={true}`.
   Following is a non-exhaustive list of affected properties:
   - `vertical`
   - `prevent_selection`
   - `show_label`
   - `stretch`
   - `no_scroll_animation`
   - `disable_filter`
   - `more_menu`
   - `inherit`
2. `import { LocaleProps, DataAttributeTypes, DynamicElement } from '@dnb/eufemia/shared/interfaces'` was removed, and moved to `@dnb/eufemia/shared/types`.

## Discontinued Internet Explorer (IE) support

The support for Internet Explorer (IE) was removed, as Microsoft formally ended support for IE in June, 2022. Have a look at the supported [browsers and platforms](/uilib/usage/#supported-browsers-and-platforms).

With that change, Eufemia will support modern browsers that supports ES6.

1. The helpers `isIE11` and `IS_IE11` was removed.

## Web Components support

The support for Web Components, Vue and Angular was discontinued and removed.

## Breakpoints

Some [breakpoints](/uilib/usage/layout/media-queries) sizes have changed:

- **xx-large:** `1280` is now `1440` – and `80em` is now `90em`
- **x-large:** `1152` is now `1280` – and `72em` is now `80em`
- **large:** `960` is now `1152` – and `60em` is now `72em`
- **medium:** `800` is now `960` – and `50em` is now `60em`

1. Find `$layout-x-large` and replace with `$layout-large`
1. Find `$layout-xx-large` and replace with `$layout-x-large`
1. Find `--layout-x-large` and replace with `--layout-large`
1. Find `--layout-xx-large` and replace with `--layout-x-large`

**NB:** Import and use the Eufemia breakpoints directly in your code:

```scss
// breakpoints.scss
@use '@dnb/eufemia/style/core/utilities';
$layout-small: map-get($breakpoints, 'small');
$layout-medium: map-get($breakpoints, 'medium');
$layout-large: map-get($breakpoints, 'large');
```

## Breaking changes to CSS packages and imports

Find the place where you import the Eufemia styles.

1. If you did import them as so:

```js
import '@dnb/eufemia/style'
```

then you don't need to make any changes.

2. If you did import `/core` etc. – then you have to change it to the import above(see 1.):

```js
import '@dnb/eufemia/style/core'
import '@dnb/eufemia/style/themes/ui'
```

3. If you did import the styles as CSS files, then you have to change it to the import above(see 1.):

```js
import '@dnb/eufemia/style/dnb-ui-core.min.css'
import '@dnb/eufemia/style/themes/theme-ui/ui-theme-components.min.css'
import '@dnb/eufemia/style/themes/theme-ui/ui-theme-basis.min.css'
```

4. If you did import `/basis`, `/components`, and `themes/ui` like so (commonly done in `EufemiaStyleImporter` files):

```js
import '@dnb/eufemia/style/basis'
import '@dnb/eufemia/style/components'
import '@dnb/eufemia/style/themes/ui'
```

Change to:

```js
import '@dnb/eufemia/style/basis'
import '@dnb/eufemia/style/themes/ui'
```

More details about the change:

- The package `dnb-theme-ui` was renamed to `ui-theme-basis`.
- The package `dnb-ui-components` was renamed and moved inside a theme `/style/themes/theme-ui/ui-theme-components.*`.
- `dnb-ui-tags` was renamed and moved from `/style/dnb-ui-tags.*` to `/style/themes/theme-ui/ui-theme-tags.*`.
- **NB:** When using the `eiendom` theme, the same applies as with `ui`, just use `eiendom` instead.

## Properties

The DNB `properties.scss` and `properties.js` files were moved inside a theme folder `/style/themes/theme-ui/properties.*`.

Packages such as:

- `dnb-ui-basis`
- `dnb-ui-core`

do not contain the properties anymore. Properties are only a part of a theme file, such as: `/style/themes/theme-ui/ui-theme-basis.*`.

As long as you don't import them in your application, you don't need to make any changes in your codebase.

Following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of changes that could be relevant for your application:

1. Find references to `@dnb/eufemia/style/properties` and replace it with `@dnb/eufemia/style/themes/theme-ui/properties`.

   From:

   ```js
   import properties from '@dnb/eufemia/style/properties'
   ```

   To:

   ```js
   import properties from '@dnb/eufemia/style/themes/theme-ui/properties'
   ```

1. Find references to `@dnb/eufemia/cjs/style/properties` and replace it with `@dnb/eufemia/cjs/style/themes/theme-ui/properties`.

   From:

   ```js
   import properties from '@dnb/eufemia/style/properties'
   ```

   To:

   ```js
   import properties from '@dnb/eufemia/cjs/style/themes/theme-ui/properties'
   ```

1. Find references to `@dnb/eufemia/style/dnb-ui-properties.min.css` and replace it with `@dnb/eufemia/style/themes/theme-ui/ui-theme-properties.min.css`.

## Removal of `data-testid` in components

You may [use other methods](/uilib/usage/best-practices/for-testing/) to select and test the inner parts of Eufemia components. You could use e.g. `screen.queryByRole`, `screen.queryByRole` or `document.querySelector`. All of the following components are effected by the change:

1. [Avatar](/uilib/components/avatar).
1. [Badge](/uilib/components/badge).
1. [Breadcrumb](/uilib/components/breadcrumb).
1. [InfoCard](/uilib/components/info-card).
1. [Tag](/uilib/components/tag).
1. [Timeline](/uilib/components/timeline).
1. [Upload](/uilib/components/upload).

## SCSS mixins

Find the SCSS @mixin `fakeFocus` and replace it with `focusRing`.
Find the SCSS @mixin `removeFakeFocus` and replace it with `removeFocusRing`.

## Fonts assets

The DNB font is moved inside a subfolder in `/assets/fonts/dnb/...`.

The CSS package `dnb-ui-fonts` is moved inside a theme folder `/themes/theme-ui`.

CSS Packages such as:

- `dnb-ui-basis`
- `dnb-ui-core`

do not contain the fonts anymore. Fonts are now only a part of a theme file, such as: `/style/themes/theme-ui/ui-theme-basis.*`.

As long as you don't import them manually, you don't need to make any changes in your codebase.

Find references to `@dnb/eufemia/assets/fonts/` and replace it with `@dnb/eufemia/assets/fonts/dnb/`.
For instance, changing from:

```js
import exampleFont from '@dnb/eufemia/assets/fonts/exampleFont.woff2'
```

To:

```js
import exampleFont from '@dnb/eufemia/assets/fonts/dnb/exampleFont.woff2'
```

## SVG assets

All `svg` icon files were moved inside a subfolder in `/assets/icons/dnb/...`.

## Browser assets

DNB browser assets (`assets/browser`) have been moved inside a subfolder: `assets/browser/dnb`.

Find references to `assets/browser` and replace it with `assets/browser/dnb`.

## Component changes

### [StepIndicator](/uilib/components/step-indicator)

1. Find the `active_item` property and replace it with `current_step`.
1. Find `use_navigation` and remove it or replace it with `mode="strict"` or `mode="loose"`.
1. URL support has been removed – so props like `active_url`, `url`, `url_future`, and `url_passed` are not supported anymore. You have to handle it by yourself from inside your application. Here is [an example](/uilib/components/step-indicator/#stepindicator-with-a-router).

1. Find and remove `Table.StickyHelper`.
1. Consider to add a CSS Class to each sub element or import it from the package:
   1. `tr` => `.dnb-table__tr` or `import { Tr } from '@dnb/eufemia'`.
   1. `th` => `.dnb-table__th` or `import { Th } from '@dnb/eufemia'`.
   1. `td` => `.dnb-table__td` or `import { Td } from '@dnb/eufemia'`.

### [Slider](/uilib/components/slider)

1. Find the `thump_title` property and replace it with `thumbTitle`.
1. Find the snake_case `add_title` property and replace it with `addTitle`.
1. Find the snake_case `subtract_title` property and replace it with `subtractTitle`.
1. Remove `@dnb/eufemia/components/slider/style/dnb-range.min.css` and use the Eufemia Slider component instead.
1. `use_scrollwheel` and `on_init` properties, as well as the `raw_value` event value from Slider was removed in order to support multiple buttons.

### [Timeline](/uilib/components/timeline)

1. Find the `name` property in your Timeline JSX syntax and replace it with `title`.
1. Find the `date` property in your Timeline JSX syntax and replace it with `subtitle`.

### [Anchor](/uilib/components/anchor)

The Anchor was moved from `/elements` to `/components`.

1. Find imports like `from '@dnb/eufemia/elements'` or `from '@dnb/eufemia/elements/anchor'`, and change the import to `import { Anchor } from '@dnb/eufemia'`.
1. Find the `target_blank_title` property and replace it with `targetBlankTitle`.

**NB:** ESM and UMD packages: The Anchor is now also a part if `dnb-ui-components` instead of `dnb-ui-elements`.

### [Button](/uilib/components/button)

1. The padding of the `tertiary` button is removed. Please, check your application and add back the padding of `0.5rem` if needed.
1. The property `global_status_id` is deprecated, and replaced with the new `globalStatus` property. Read more about `globalStatus` [here](/uilib/components/global-status/properties/#configuration-object).
   Find occurrences of `global_status_id`, like `global_status_id="my-id"`, and replace it with `globalStatus={{id: "my-id"}}`.

### [Pagination](/uilib/components/pagination) and [InfinityScroller](/uilib/components/pagination/infinity-scroller)

1. Replace the deprecated event return parameter `page` with `pageNumber`.

   The usage of `data-test-id` will most likely be found in your tests.

### [Modal](/uilib/components/modal), [Dialog](/uilib/components/dialog) and [Drawer](/uilib/components/drawer)

1. `closeButtonAttributes` of Modal, Dialog, and Drawer is deprecated and no longer supported.

2. Modal's `mode` property is now deprecated and removed.
   In earlier versions, the `mode` property defaulted to `dialog`. So if you've used `<Modal />` without the `mode` property, which would default to `mode="dialog"`, please convert from `<Modal />` to `<Dialog />` as of v10.
   `<Modal />` now(as of v10) behaves as `<Modal mode="custom" />` did in previous versions of eufemia.

   When you convert from `<Modal mode="custom" />` simply change to `<Modal />`.

   When you convert from `<Modal mode="drawer" />` to `<Drawer />` – follow these steps:

   1. All `trigger_*` props are not supported for Drawer, use `triggerAttributes` instead to pass in props for the trigger button.

      - Change prop `trigger_hidden` to `omitTriggerButton` to omit the default trigger button from Modal.

   2. Only camelCase props are supported for Drawer, so you will need to update the prop names.
   3. `Modal.Inner` or `Modal.Content` converts to `Drawer.Body`.
   4. `Modal.Bar` converts to `Drawer.Navigation`.
   5. `Modal` was a class component and `Drawer` is a functional component.

   When you convert from `<Modal />` or `<Modal mode="dialog" />` to `<Dialog />` – follow these steps:

   1. All `trigger_*` props are not supported for Dialog, use `triggerAttributes` instead to pass in props for the trigger button.

      - Change prop `trigger_hidden` to `omitTriggerButton` to omit the default trigger button from Modal.

   2. Only camelCase props are supported for Dialog, so you will need to update the prop names.
   3. `Modal.Inner` or `Modal.Content` converts to `Dialog.Body`.
   4. `Modal.Bar` converts to `Dialog.Navigation`.
   5. `Modal` was a class component and `Dialog` is a functional component.

### [Lists](/uilib/elements/lists)

1. New **Definition List** layout direction: `direction="horizontal"` including `Dl.Item` [demo](/uilib/elements/lists/#definition-list-in-horizontal-direction).

### [InputMasked](/uilib/components/input-masked)

1. In v10, InputMasked **allows leading zeros**. To prevent that behavior, the property `allowLeadingZeroes` has changed to `disallowLeadingZeroes`.
