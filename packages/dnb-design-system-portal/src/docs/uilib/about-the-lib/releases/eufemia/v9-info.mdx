## Migration

v9 of @dnb/eufemia contains _breaking changes_. As a migration process, you can simply search and replace:

### General

1. Uninstall `dnb-ui-lib` and install `@dnb/eufemia`.
1. Rename with Regex `("|')dnb-ui-lib` and replace with `$1@dnb/eufemia`.
1. Rename `node_modules/dnb-ui-lib/` and replace with `node_modules/dnb/eufemia/`.
1. Find `formRow` inside a (e.g. \<Provider formRow= ...) and replace it with `FormRow` (PascalCase).

### Number to NumberFormat

1. Find the `Number` component and rename it with `NumberFormat`.
1. Find the `dnb-number` and replace it with `dnb-number-format`.
1. In case you import it from `components/number/Number`, it has to be `components/number-format/NumberFormat`.
1. In case you use `format` or `cleanNumber` from either `/components/Number` or `/components/number/Number`, replace the import path to be `/components/number-format/NumberUtils`.
1. You can also use Regex: Find `Number([^F)]|$)` and replace it with `NumberFormat$1`.

### Tabs props

Tabs has changed two property names.

1. Find `section_style` in `<Tabs section_style="..." />` and replace with `tabs_style`.
1. Find `section_spacing` in `<Tabs section_spacing="..." />` and replace with `tabs_spacing`.

### Helper classes

1. Removed `dnb-belt`
1. Removed `dnb-hide-on-mobile`
1. Removed `dnb-mobile-exclusive`
1. Removed `dnb-width-limit`

### Patterns to Extensions

Most of the Eufemia "patterns" got removed in favor of calling this part as **extensions**.

1. Find `dnb-ui-lib/patterns` or `@dnb/eufemia/patterns` and replace with `@dnb/eufemia/extensions`
