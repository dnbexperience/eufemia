## Features

[DatePicker](/uilib/components/date-picker)

- added `min_date` and `max_date` props, with a event return of `is_valid_start_date` and `is_valid_end_date`
- got a new prop `show_reset_button` to show a _Reset_ button inside the DatePicker footer / toolbar.

[Input](/uilib/components/input)

- added `keep_placeholder` property to component which will keep the placeholder visible as long as there is not entered a value. In some circumstances this is a better solution. E.g. in combination with the [InputMaksed](/uilib/components/input-masked) and a _e-mail_ mask.

[Number](/uilib/components/number)

- added `currency_display` property to include [shared Provider](/uilib/components/number-format/provider) support.
- enhanced NVDA support.

[Modal](/uilib/components/modal)

- have `dnb-core-style` class set by default to the Modal content - prevent this by using the `prevent_core_style` prop.

[Anchor / Text link](/uilib/elements/anchor)

- `target="_blank"` with `href="http*"` will get an icon added, showing that the link is a "link out" of the current context. You can prevent the link to appear by using a HTML class: `dnb-anchor--no-icon`.

[Lists](/uilib/elements/lists)

- Enhanced support on nested lists, especially on ordered lists (with numbers).

[Icon](/uilib/components/icon)

- added `border` property to to show a rounded border on icons.
