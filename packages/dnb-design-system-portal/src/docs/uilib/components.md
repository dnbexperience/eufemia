# Components

DNB Eufemia components are ready to use, styled and custom build HTML elements.

## [FormSet](/uilib/components/form-set)

The `FormSet` component gives You both a HTML form element `<form>` by default and also a React provider for [FormRow](/uilib/components/form-row). This way You can define more globally e.g. if all the rows should be displayed **vertically**.

The main `Icon` component is basically a wrapper for whatever icon you place within it. This means a span wrapping an inline svg.

## [IconPrimary](/uilib/components/icon-primary)

The `IconPrimary` component loads by default all Primary Icons so they can easily be included and used without additionally importing every icon.

## [Input](/uilib/components/input)

The input component is an umbrella component for all inputs which share the same style as the classic text input field. Radio buttons and other form elements are not included here.

## [InputMasked](/uilib/components/input-masked)

The `InputMasked` component uses the DNB Eufemia normal input component, but with some additional masking functionality. Read more about the details on the open source project.
