The component is designed to let you compose different parts according to your technical needs.

By default, the Accordion component animates user events, resulting in a final height of `auto`. This keeps the content responsive after the animation ends.

### Accordion provider

Use the `Accordion.Provider` to pass accordion properties to all nested accordions.

### Accordion groups

Both `Accordion.Provider` and `Accordion.Group` are available. They're technically the same, except that `Accordion.Group` automatically provides a unique `group` id, making all nested accordions work together and close each other when one opens.

#### Unexpected behavior

**Note:** Please avoid using a group when possible, as it creates unexpected behavior from an accessibility perspective. When a user interacts with one accordion, it triggers an action elsewhere, outside the current context—something users may not expect. It's an automated, out-of-context UI execution.
