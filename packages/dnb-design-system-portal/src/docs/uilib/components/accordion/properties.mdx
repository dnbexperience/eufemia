## Properties

These properties can send along with the `Accordion.Provider` or `Accordion.Group`. It will affect every nested `Accordion`.

| Accordion Properties                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                                    | _(optional)_ a unique `id` that will be used on the button element. If you use `remember_state`, an id is required.                                                                                                                          |
| `title`                                 | _(optional)_ a title as a string or React element. It will be used as the button text.                                                                                                                                                       |
| `expanded`                              | _(optional)_ if set to `true` the accordion will be expanded as its initial state.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `expanded_ssr`                          | _(optional)_ if set to `true` the accordion will be expanded during SSR. Can be potentially useful for SEO, although it will disturb client hydration, where React expects the same state. But that's mainly a technical aspect to consider. |
| `remember_state`                        | _(optional)_ if set to `true`, it will remember a changed state initiated by the user. It requires a unique `id`. It will store the sate in the local storage.                                                                               |
| `flush_remembered_state`                | _(optional)_ if set to `true`, the saved (remembered) will be removed and the initial component state will be used and set.                                                                                                                  |
| `no_animation`                          | _(optional)_ if set to `true`, the open and close animation will be omitted.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `variant`                               | _(optional)_ defines the used styling. `outlined`, `filled`, or `plain`(no styling). Defaults to `outlined`.                                                                                                                                 |
| `icon`                                  | _(optional)_ will replace the `chevron` icon. The icon will still rotate (by CSS). You can use an object to use two different icons, one for the closed state and one for the expanded state `{ closed, expanded }`.                         |
| `icon_position`                         | _(optional)_ will set the placement of the icon. Defaults to `left`.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `icon_size`                             | _(optional)_ define a different icon size. Defaults to `medium` (1.5rem).                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `left_component`                        | _(optional)_ will add a React element on the left side of the `title`, inside `AccordionHeaderContainer`.                                                                                                                                    |
| `prerender`                             | _(optional)_ if set to `true` the content will be present, even the accordion is not expanded. Can be useful for assistive technology or SEO.                                                                                                |
| `prevent_rerender`                      | _(optional)_ if set to `true` the accordion component will not re-render its content – can be useful for widgets you don't have control of storing the temporary state during an interaction.                                                |
| `prevent_rerender_conditional`          | _(optional)_ use this prop together with `prevent_rerender` – and if it is to `true`, the accordion component will re-render if the children are a new React element and does not match the previous one anymore.                            |
| `single_container`                      | _(optional)_ if set to `true`, a group of accordions will be wrapped to sidebar looking menu for medium and larger screens.                                                                                                                  |
