## Import

```tsx
import { Anchor } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

The Anchor, also known as `Link`, is used to navigate from one page to the next HTML page.

```jsx
import { Link, Anchor } from '@dnb/eufemia'
render(<Anchor href="/uilib/components/anchor">Accessible text</Anchor>)
```

### Combine a Link with an Anchor

You can combine a meta framework link with the Anchor. This way, all the framework-provided features will still work, as well as the behavior of the Eufemia Anchor.

```jsx
import Anchor from '@dnb/eufemia/components/Anchor'
import { Link } from 'gatsby'

render(
  <App>
    <Anchor element={Link} to="/path">
      Link
    </Anchor>
  </App>
)
```

## Blank target

**NB:** If you only use a vanilla HTML anchor element including `target="_blank"`, then you have to ensure you add a `title` attribute that includes `Opens a new Window` or as part of the text:

```html
<a
  title="Opens a new Window"
  target="_blank"
  href="https://"
  class="dnb-anchor"
>
  text (opens in new window)
</a>
```
