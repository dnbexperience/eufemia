## Description

AriaLive is a React component and hook that helps make your web app more accessible by announcing dynamic changes to screen readers.

Use it to manually inform users using a screen reader, about changes on the screen that isn't normally covered by screen readers.

By default, the `AriaLive` component will announce changes to the screen reader in a polite manner. This means that the announcement will wait until the screen reader is idle. This is the recommended way to use the component.

## Usage

For text content:

```tsx
import { AriaLive } from '@dnb/eufemia'
render(<AriaLive>unvisible message to announce</AriaLive>)
```

For content that is not visible, but should be announced on changes:

```tsx
import { AriaLive } from '@dnb/eufemia'
render(
  <AriaLive variant="content">
    <ul>
      <li>item one</li>
      <li>item two</li>
      {/* When item three appears, it will be announced */}
    </ul>
  </AriaLive>,
)
```

## Priority

The `priority` prop in the `AriaLive` component is used to control the urgency of the announcement. It can be set to `high` (defaults to `low`). This allows you to control how assertive the announcement should be, helping to create a better user experience for users who rely on screen readers.

## AriaLive Hook

The `useAriaLive` hook is a part of the `AriaLive` component. It can be used to make announcements in functional components. Here's an example of how to use it:

```tsx
import useAriaLive from '@dnb/eufemia/components/aria-live/useAriaLive'

function MyCustomAriaLive(props) {
  const ariaAttributes = useAriaLive(props)
  return <section {...ariaAttributes} />
}
```
