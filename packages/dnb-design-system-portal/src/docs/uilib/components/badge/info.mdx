### Badge variants

#### Notification Badge

The notification badge has a very limited use. The area of use is currently limited to a counter of messages in the message center.

#### Information Badge

Can be used to describe or inform about new activity or features in our applications. The label can be placed on top of element backgrounds or inline with text within cells.

The logic of how long it should be visible would differ from case to case, so that's up to the designer.
