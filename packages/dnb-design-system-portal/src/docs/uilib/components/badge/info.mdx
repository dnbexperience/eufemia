### Badge variants

#### Information Badge

Can be used to describe or inform about new activity or features in our applications. The label can be placed on top of element backgrounds or inline with text within cells.

The logic of how long it should be visible would differ from case to case, so that's up to the designer.

#### Notification Badge

The notification badge has a very limited use.
Area of use is limited as of now, as a counter of messages in the message's center.

We only show single digits in the counter. If there are more notifications than that, we show “9+”.
