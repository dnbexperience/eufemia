## Demos

### Breadcrumb

To ensure the correct use of the Breadcrumb, we recommend passing down pages as a variable to `data`. If you have other specific cases, check out how to customize with [children in Breadcrumb](/uilib/components/breadcrumb/#pages-as-child-components).

<BreadcrumbDefault />

- The first item, `Home`, gets assigned a home icon and an appropriate text label based on the current locale.
- The last item in pages will be static text, corresponding to the current page.
- Breadcumb will collapse on small screens

### Pages as child components

For customizing the Breadcrumb to fit your needs, you can add each page as a child component.

<BreadcrumbChildren />

### Single Breadcrumb

When you only want a single button for `back`.

<BreadcrumbSingle />

This can also be forced using the `variant="single"` prop.

### Always be collapsed (`variant="collapse"`)

Expands when user clicks

<BreadcrumbCollapse />

### Never collapse (`variant="multiple"`)

<BreadcrumbMultiple />
