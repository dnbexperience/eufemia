### Signal button

Medium is equivalent to 24, but responsive. To import custom icons, use: `import { bell_medium as Bell } from '@dnb/eufemia/icons'`

<ButtonSignal />

### Large Signal button

Large Signal button with medium sized icon. To import custom icons, use: `import { bell_medium as Bell } from '@dnb/eufemia/icons'`

<ButtonSignalLarge />

</VisibilityByTheme>

### Icon button

When the button has no text an `aria-label` attribute is required for accessibility. And a `title` attribute is recommended for mouse hover.

We automatically add an `aria-label` with the same value as `title` if `text` and `children` properties are undefined. So in most cases you only have to set the `title` property.

<ButtonIcon />

### Custom button content

This is, as all of the demos, only an example of how to achieve various needs, and not that you should do it.

<ButtonCustomContent />

<VisibleWhenVisualTest>

<ButtonErrorState />

</VisibleWhenVisualTest>

<VisibilityByTheme visible="sbanken">

### Button on dark background

When placing the button on a dark background wrap the content of the dark section with `<Theme.Provider darkBackground>`
to get the correct styles.

<ButtonHasDarkBackground />

</VisibilityByTheme>
