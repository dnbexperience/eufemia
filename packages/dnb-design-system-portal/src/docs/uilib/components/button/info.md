## Description

The Button component should be used as the **primary call-to-action** in a form, or as a user interaction mechanism. There should never be more than one primary button in a given context (e.g. a [action-nav](/uilib/extensions/action-nav)); `secondary` and `tertiary` button variants does not have this constraint. Generally speaking, a button should not be used when a link would suffice.
