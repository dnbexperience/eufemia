### Variants and sizes

There should never be more than one `primary` button in a given context; `secondary` and `tertiary` button variants do not have this constraint. Generally speaking, a button should not be used when a link would suffice.

The Button component comes in different sizes.

For variant primary, the recommended sizes are `default` and `large`.

<PrimaryButtonSizes />

For variant secondary, the recommended sizes are `default` and `large`.

<SecondaryButtonSizes />

For variant tertiary, the recommended size is `default`. A variant with `iconPosition="top"` is also available for use.
It is **not** recommended to use the tertiary button without an icon. Looking for a similar variant without an icon? You might want to check out [Anchor](/uilib/components/anchor) instead.

<TertiaryButtonSizes />

<VisibilityByTheme hidden="sbanken">

For variant signal, the recommended sizes are `default` and `large`.

<SignalButtonSizes />

</VisibilityByTheme>

Icon buttons come in all sizes.

<IconButtonSizes />
