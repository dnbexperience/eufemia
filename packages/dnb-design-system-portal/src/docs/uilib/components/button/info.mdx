### Variants and sizes

There should never be more than one `primary` button in a given context. The `secondary` and `tertiary` button variants do not have this constraint. A button should not be used when a link would suffice.

The Button component comes in different sizes.

For the primary variant, the recommended sizes are `default` and `large`.

<PrimaryButtonSizes />

For the secondary variant, the recommended sizes are `default` and `large`.

<SecondaryButtonSizes />

For the tertiary variant, the recommended size is `default`. A variant with `iconPosition="top"` is also available.

It is **not** recommended to use the tertiary button without an icon. Looking for a similar variant without an icon? Check out [Anchor](/uilib/components/anchor) instead.

<TertiaryButtonSizes />

<VisibilityByTheme hidden="sbanken">

For the signal variant, the recommended sizes are `default` and `large`.

<SignalButtonSizes />

</VisibilityByTheme>

Icon buttons come in all sizes.

<IconButtonSizes />
