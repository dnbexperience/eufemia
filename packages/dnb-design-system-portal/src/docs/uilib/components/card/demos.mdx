## Demo

### Default border

<Examples.Default />

### Vertical fields

<Examples.VerticalFields />

### Horizontal fields

<Examples.HorizontalFields />

### Stack

When `stack` is set to `true`, the Card will add a gap between its children and stretch them to the full.

For [form components](uilib/extensions/forms/), you should [Form.Card](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Card/) instead of the original Card component.

<Examples.Stack />

### Nested Cards

Nested cards have `responsive={false}` by default and will not behave responsive.

<Examples.NestedCards />

## With `outset`

When using `outset`, the Card will break out of the layout container.
On small screens (mobile) the outset is removed.

<Examples.WithOutset />

### Without padding

<Examples.WithoutPadding />

### With nested Section

The Card components needs to have `stack={true}` or `align="stretch"` in order to stretch its children components.

<Examples.WithNestedSection />

### With Table

<Examples.WithTable />

### With Grid

Grid wraps the Cards nicely on smaller screens.

<Examples.WithGrid />

### With Flex

While Flex has the horizontal direction, it uses rowGap when wrapping. So it's the container spacing the Cards then. This is not ideal, because the Cards should ideally have no gap, like in the Grid example above.

<Examples.WithFlex />
