## Demo

### Default border

<Examples.Default />

### Vertical fields

<Examples.VerticalFields />

### Horizontal fields

<Examples.HorizontalFields />

### Stack

The Card components needs to have `stack={true}` or `align="stretch"` in order to stretch its children components.

For [form components](uilib/extensions/forms/), you should use `stack={true}` to get the correct spacing.

<Examples.Stack />

### Nested Cards

Nested cards have `responsive={false}` by default and will not behave responsive.

<Examples.NestedCards />

### Without padding

<Examples.WithoutPadding />

### With nested Section

The Card components needs to have `stack={true}` or `align="stretch"` in order to stretch its children components.

<Examples.WithNestedSection />

### With Table

<Examples.WithTable />

### With Grid

Grid wraps the Cards nicely on smaller screens.

<Examples.WithGrid />

### With Flex

While Flex has the horizontal direction, it uses rowGap when wrapping. So it's the container spacing the Cards then. This is not ideal, because the Cards should ideally have no gap, like in the Grid example above.

<Examples.WithFlex />
