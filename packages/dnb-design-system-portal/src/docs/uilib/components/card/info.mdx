## Description

`Card` is a block section element showing the white box with rounded gray borders, adding spacing automatically.

It uses [Layout.FlexItem](/uilib/components/layout/FlexItem) under the hood. When one of these props where given, `stack`, `direction` or `spacing` â€“ the [Layout.FlexContainer](/uilib/components/layout/FlexContainer) will be used.

**BETA:** The design is not 100% finalised and may change to be officially approved by UX through an RFC.

## Accessibility

It uses a `section` element. Which allows you to add an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to provide screen readers with landmarks.
