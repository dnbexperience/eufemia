## Import

```tsx
import { Card } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

`Card` is a block section element showing the white box with rounded gray borders, adding spacing automatically.

It uses [Flex.Item](/uilib/layout/flex/item) under the hood. When one of these props were given, `stack`, `direction` or `spacing` â€“ the [Flex.Container](/uilib/layout/flex/container) will be used.

**BETA:** The design is not 100% finalised and may change to be officially approved by UX through an RFC.

```jsx
import { Card } from '@dnb/eufemia'
import { Form, Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

render(
  <Form.Handler data={existingData} onSubmit={submitHandler}>
    <Card>
      <Field.Email path="/dataPath" />
      <Form.ButtonRow>
        <Form.SubmitButton />
      </Form.ButtonRow>
    </Card>
  </Form.Handler>,
)
```

## Accessibility

It uses a `section` element. Which allows you to add an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to provide screen readers with landmarks.
