import { SupportedFormats } from 'Docs/uilib/components/date-format/Examples'

## Import

```tsx
import { DateFormat } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

A ready to use DNB date formatter. Use it wherever you want to format dates.

Good reasons to use this component:

- Makes the date formatting uniform for all DNB applications.
- Makes dates accessible to screen readers.

The component is using `Intl.DateTimeFormat` browser API, to format dates based on locale. It also uses the [time element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/time) to ensure that the date is readable for screen readers.
