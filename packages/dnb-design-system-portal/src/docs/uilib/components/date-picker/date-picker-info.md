## Description

The `DatePicker` component should be used whenever there is to enter a single date or a date range/period with a start and end date.

### Date Object

The date-picker operates with a default JavaScript Date instance as well as string (ISO 8601) like `start_date="2019-05-05"`.

For more `DatePicker` examples, have a look at [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/embed/q88v3r8w6).
