### Date Object

The DatePicker operates with a default JavaScript Date instance as well as string (ISO 8601) like `start_date="2019-05-05"` (yyyy-MM-dd).

### Validation for `minDate`, `maxDate` and invalid dates

`Field.Date` has [built in validation](https://eufemia.dnb.no/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields/Date/#date-limit-validation]) for `minDate`, `maxDate` and invalid dates.
This is the preferred method of handling scenarios where the user has typed in an invalid date, or a date outside of the set date limits.
Automatically changing the user input on the other hand, leads to worse UX, and confusion, as the user might not understand why the date is changed, for seemingly no reason.
So it's best practice to actually tell the user what is wrong, and let them correct it.
