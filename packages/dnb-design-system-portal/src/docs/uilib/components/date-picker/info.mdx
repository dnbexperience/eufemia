## Description

The DatePicker component should be used whenever there is to enter a single date or a date range/period with a start and end date.

### Date Object

The DatePicker operates with a default JavaScript Date instance as well as string (ISO 8601) like `start_date="2019-05-05"` (yyyy-MM-dd).
