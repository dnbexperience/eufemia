## Import

```tsx
import { DatePicker } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

The DatePicker component should be used whenever there is to enter a single date or a date range/period with a start and end date.

### Date Object

The DatePicker operates with a default JavaScript Date instance as well as string (ISO 8601) like `start_date="2019-05-05"` (yyyy-MM-dd).

For more _DatePicker_ examples, have a look at [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/embed/q88v3r8w6).

### Translations and date formatting

The `DatePicker` uses `date-fns` to format date texts in the calendar, i.e. the month and weekday names. Currently, the `DatePicker` only supports `nb-NO`, `en-GB`, `en-US` and `sv-SE` locales, so it will fallback to use `nb-NO` as default if you set the `locale` prop on the [Provider](/uilib/usage/customisation/provider) to be something other than the locales supported by the `DatePicker`.
