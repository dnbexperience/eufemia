## Import

```tsx
import { Dialog } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

The Dialog component is a [Modal](/uilib/components/modal) variation that appears at the center of the screen. The Dialog has similar functionality to a traditional popup window. Similar to Modal, it has to be triggered by the user to appear. Typical usage would be to read an explanation, then close it.

### Variants

There are two variants of the Dialog component: `information` and `confirmation`.

<InlineImg
  height="230"
  width="auto"
  src={DialogInformExample}
  caption="Example of an informational Dialog"
  className="mint-green-12"
/>
<InlineImg
  height="230"
  width="auto"
  src={DialogConfirmExample}
  caption="Example of a confirmation Dialog"
  className="mint-green-12"
/>

The informational variant (`information`) is used for informational purposes, for example explaining a word or something on the page. It has to be triggered by the user to appear. Typical usage would be to read an explanation, then close it.

The confirmation variant (`confirmation`) is used when some action is needed, or if we need to inform the user of something without them triggering it. A couple of examples would be a scenario where the user confirms deleting something, or if the user has been logged out automatically and we need to inform them, or a cookie consent dialog.

### Parts in Dialog

To provide custom content to parts of the Dialog, a set of component parts are provided:

- `<Dialog.Navigation>`: The navigation field at the top of the component, default with a close button (Equal to the property `navContent`).
- `<Dialog.Header>`: The header field of the component, where the `title` will appear (Equal to the property `headerContent`).
- `<Dialog.Action>`: An optional field for buttons at the bottom of the component. This field will appear by default for variant `confirmation`.
