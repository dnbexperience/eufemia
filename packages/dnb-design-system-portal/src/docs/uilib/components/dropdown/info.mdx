```tsx
import { Dropdown } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

The Dropdown component is a fully custom-made component. This allows us to change its form based on context (small screens, touch devices, etc.).

### When to use

Use a dropdown when you need to provide many options to the user but don't have space to display them all. The hidden options should only appear when the user requests them, reducing visual clutter.

1. When space is limited
1. When you want to reduce visual clutter
1. When it's intuitive for users to request hidden content

### When not to use

1. Do not use a dropdown if you have only a few options that could be shown using [Radio buttons](/uilib/components/radio) or [ToggleButtons](/uilib/components/toggle-button).

**Note:** This pattern can be constructed in various ways to achieve a similar effect—from using the HTML `select` element to custom building with divs, spans, and JavaScript.

## Action menu

The Dropdown component can be used as an **action button** by setting `action_menu={true}`. In mobile view, the title/text will be hidden, showing only the icon, and the DrawerList will open from the bottom of the browser.

## Menu button

The Dropdown component can be used as a **menu button** by setting `more_menu={true}`, which displays the [more](/icons/primary#icon-more) icon (appears as dots). You can also use `prevent_selection={true}` together with an empty title `title=""` and `aria-label="Choose an item"`.

## Accessibility

For both the Action Menu and the Menu Button (and when `prevent_selection` is true), the Dropdown will use `role="menu"` instead of `role="menuitems"` for better screen reader support.

## Custom size

You can change the **width** of the Dropdown component with CSS by using:

```css
.dnb-dropdown {
  --dropdown-width: 20rem; /* custom width */
}
```

You can also set the width directly, but then it has to be defined like so (including `min-width`):

```css
/** Because of the included label/status etc. we target the "__shell" */
.dnb-dropdown__shell {
  width: 10rem;
}

/** In order to change only the drawer-list width */
.dnb-dropdown .dnb-drawer-list__root {
  width: 10rem;
}

/** If more_menu={true} is used */
.dnb-dropdown--is-popup .dnb-drawer-list__root {
  width: 10rem;
}
```
