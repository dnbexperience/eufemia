## Import

```tsx
import { Dropdown } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

The Dropdown component is a fully custom-made component. This allows us to change its form based on context (small screens, touch devices, etc.).

### When to use it

When you need to provide a considerable amount of options to the user and do not have the space to do so. Other reasons may be that the hidden options may clutter the interface and should only be displayed after the user specifically requests them.

1. When space is an issue (not enough).
1. When you wish to reduce visual clutter.
1. When it is intuitive for the user to request the hidden content.

### When not to use it

1. Do not use this if you have only a few options that could otherwise be shown, such as [Radio buttons](/uilib/components/radio) or [ToggleButtons](/uilib/components/toggle-button).

**NB:** This pattern can be constructed in a number of ways to achieve a similar effect - from using the HTML 'select' element to custom building with divs, spans, and JavaScript.

## Action Menu

The Dropdown component can easily be used as a so-called **action button** by setting the property `action_menu={true}`. In mobile view, the title/text will be hidden, showing only the icon, and the DrawerList will open from the browser bottom.

## Menu Button

The Dropdown component can easily be used as a so-called **menu button** by setting the property `more_menu={true}`, which shows the [more](/icons/primary#icon-more) icon (appears as dots). You can also use `prevent_selection={true}` together with an empty title `title=""` and `aria-label="Choose an item"`.

## Accessibility

Both the Action Menu and the Menu Button (and if `preventSelection` is true), the Dropdown will use `role="menu"`, instead of `role="menuitems"` for better screen reader support.

## Custom size

Changing the **width** of the Dropdown component with CSS is easily done by using:

```css
.dnb-dropdown {
  --dropdown-width: 20rem; /* custom width */
}
```

You can also set the width directly, but then it has to be defined like so (including `min-width`):

```css
/** Because of the included label/status etc. we target the "__shell" */
.dnb-dropdown__shell {
  width: 10rem;
}

/** In order to change only the drawer-list width */
.dnb-dropdown .dnb-drawer-list__root {
  width: 10rem;
}

/** If more_menu={true} is used */
.dnb-dropdown--is-popup .dnb-drawer-list__root {
  width: 10rem;
}
```
