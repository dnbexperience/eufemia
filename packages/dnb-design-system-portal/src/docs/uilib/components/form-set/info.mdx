import { FormSetInfoVertical } from 'Docs/uilib/components/form-set/Examples'

## Description

The FormSet component gives you both a HTML form element `<form>` by default and also a React provider for [FormRow](/uilib/components/form-row). This way you can define more globally e.g. if all the rows should be displayed **vertically**.

<FormSetInfoVertical />
