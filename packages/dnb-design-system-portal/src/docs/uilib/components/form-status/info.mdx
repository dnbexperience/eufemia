### Width alignment

In order to enhance accessibility (readability), the FormStatus will align its width to a linked component. That means, if the FormStatus is build into the Input component, it will inherit the width of the input.

The `min-width` is set to be **12rem**. Use CSS `min-width` or `max-width` to set a custom (manual) width.
