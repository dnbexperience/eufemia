import FormStatusIcons from 'Docs/icons/form-status.mdx'

## Import

```tsx
import { FormStatus } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

The FormStatus is a simple component meant for displaying the status of a form ( displaying form errors, messages etc. )
The `FormStatus` component should be positioned relative to the form or form input to which it referring to.

Also, the `FormStatus` is used inside of many other form components.

The `FormStatus` component cooperates together with the [GlobalStatus](/uilib/components/global-status) component to summaries and have several status messages in once place.

## Accessibility

The `FormStatus` component is designed to be accessible. It is important to provide a meaningful message to the user. The `FormStatus` component should be used to provide feedback to the user about the status of the form or form input.

The `FormStatus` should be placed in the DOM before the form element itself and it should be linked together with the related form element by using `aria-describedby`.

This will allow screen readers to find and announce the error message without too much frustration.

This is done automatically in all Eufemia components when the `status` property is used.

Also all the [fields](/uilib/extensions/forms/all-fields/) based on the [FieldBlock](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/FieldBlock) do support this feature without additional work. The `FieldBlock` also supports grouped messages and showing an error, warning and info message at the same time.

### Width alignment

In order to enhance accessibility (readability), the FormStatus will align its width to a linked component. That means, if the FormStatus is build into the Input component, it will inherit the width of the input.

The `min-width` is set to be **12rem**. Use CSS `min-width` or `max-width` to set a custom (manual) width.
