# Fragments

Fragments are small, low-level and reusable parts used inside other components.

You may use them only to build new components from.

## Import

They are a part of components anyway, so you import them like so:

```jsx
import { DrawerList, ScrollView } from '@dnb/eufemia/fragments'
```
