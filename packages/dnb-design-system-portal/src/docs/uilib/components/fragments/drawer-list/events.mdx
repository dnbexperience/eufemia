### The `on_change` vs `on_select` difference

The difference between `on_change` and `on_select` is:

- `on_change` will be called when the state changes, either with a **click** or **space/enter** keypress confirmation.
- `on_select` differs most when the user is navigating by keyboard. Once the user is pressing e.g. the arrow keys, the selection is changing, but not the state.
