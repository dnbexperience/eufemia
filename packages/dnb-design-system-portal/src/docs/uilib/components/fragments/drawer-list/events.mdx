### The `onChange` vs `onSelect` difference

The difference between `onChange` and `onSelect` is:

- `onChange` will be called when the state changes, either with a **click** or **space/enter** keypress confirmation.
- `onSelect` differs most when the user is navigating by keyboard. Once the user is pressing e.g. the arrow keys, the selection is changing, but not the state.
