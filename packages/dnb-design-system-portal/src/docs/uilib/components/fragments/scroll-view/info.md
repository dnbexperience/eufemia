# ScrollView

ScrollView is a tiny helper component to allow Eufemia controlling the UX with context to other components.

So, it also helps other floating components like a [Dropdown](/uilib/components/dropdown) to ensure that it keeps its floating (Portals) position tied to it's root component.

```jsx
import { ScrollView } from '@dnb/eufemia/fragments'

render(<ScrollView> scrollable content </ScrollView>)
```
