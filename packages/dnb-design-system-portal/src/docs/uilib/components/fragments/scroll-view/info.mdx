# ScrollView

ScrollView is a tiny helper component helping the user controlling overflowing content horizontally or vertically.

It also is used in other floating components like [Dropdown](/uilib/components/dropdown) or [Drawer](/uilib/components/drawer).

```jsx
import { ScrollView } from '@dnb/eufemia/fragments'

render(<ScrollView> scrollable content </ScrollView>)
```
