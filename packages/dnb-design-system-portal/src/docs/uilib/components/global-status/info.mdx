## Import

```tsx
import { GlobalStatus } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

The GlobalStatus is a complex component meant for displaying global application notifications or a summary of a form (displaying form errors, messages, etc.).

By default, the `GlobalStatus` is automatically connected together with the [FormStatus](/uilib/components/form-status) component. This means that every form component showing a status will send the status message along to the `GlobalStatus`.

### FormStatus default behavior

1. Once a **FormStatus** is shown, the `main` **GlobalStatus** will show up.
1. The page will scroll (if needed) to the dedicated **GlobalStatus**.
1. Form components will send along both the status text and its label to show a good and accessible summary.
1. Screen reader users will automatically hear the entire content of the `GlobalStatus` once it shows up.

### Several GlobalStatus instances

Normally, you only want to have **one** `GlobalStatus` inside your application. But you can have several in parallel. Make sure you give every other one a new ID:

<GlobalStatusInfoExample1 />

### Where to put it

- The `GlobalStatus` component should be positioned right under the header. By default, it uses `main` as the ID.
- Or as a secondary summary of errors in a submit form. Keep in mind that, by default, form components like [Input](/uilib/components/input) use the ID `main`. To make sure the built-in [FormStatus](/uilib/components/form-status) sends the message to another `GlobalStatus`, you have to set the [`globalStatus`](/uilib/components/global-status/properties/#configuration-object), like:

<GlobalStatusInfoExample2 />

But you can also make use of the Eufemia [Provider](/uilib/usage/customisation/provider-info) where you can send the `globalStatus` to the underlying/wrapped components, like:

<GlobalStatusInfoExample3 />

### Manual updates

Besides the automated connection between the error states of form components ([FormStatus](/uilib/components/form-status)), you can update messages from anywhere in your application at any time:

**NB:** The GlobalStatus will `autoclose` by default once all messages are removed.

### JavaScript (interceptor situation)

You can access and manipulate an existing GlobalStatus from outside of the React render tree.

1. Given you have already defined a GlobalStatus in JSX:

<GlobalStatusInfoExample1 />

2. Then you can control it from within a JavaScript context whenever you need to:

<GlobalStatusInfoExampleManipulate1 />

### JSX

<GlobalStatusInfoExampleManipulate2 />

If you need an additional `GlobalStatus`, define a custom ID (custom-status):

<GlobalStatusInfoExampleManipulate3 />
