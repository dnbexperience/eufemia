## Description

The GlobalStatus is a complex component meant for displaying global Application notifications or a summary of a form ( displaying form errors, messages etc. ).
By default, the `GlobalStatus` is automatically connected together with the [FormStatus](/uilib/components/form-status) component. This means, that every form component showing a status, will send the status message along to the `GlobalStatus`.

### FormStatus default behavior

1. Once a **FormStatus** is shown, the `main` **GlobalStatus** will show up.
1. The page will scroll (if needed) to the dedicated **GlobalStatus**.
1. Form components will send along both the status text and its label to show a good and accessible summary.
1. Screen reader uses will automatically hear the whole content of the `GlobalStatus` once it shows up.

### Several Global statuses

Normally, you only want to have **one** `GlobalStatus` inside your application. But you can have several in parallel. But make sure you give every other a new ID:

<GlobalStatusInfoExample1 />

### Where to put it

- The `GlobalStatus` component should be positioned right under the header. By default, it uses `main` as the ID.
- Or as a secondary summary of errors in a submit form. Keep in mind, by default, form components like [Input](/uilib/components/input) are using the ID `main`. To make sure the build in [FormStatus](/uilib/components/form-status) is sending along the message to another `GlobalStatus`, you have to set the [`globalStatus`](/uilib/components/global-status/properties/#configuration-object), like:

<GlobalStatusInfoExample2 />

But you can also make use of the [FormSet](/uilib/layout/form-set) or [FormRow](/uilib/layout/form-row) which will send along the `globalStatus` the underlying/wrapped components, like:

<GlobalStatusInfoExample3 />

### Manually updates

Besides the automated connection between the error states of form components ([FormStatus](/uilib/components/form-status)), you can update messages from everywhere in your application at any time:

**NB:** The GlobalStatus will `autoclose` by default, once all messages are removed.

### JavaScript (interceptor situation)

You can access and manipulate an existing GlobalStatus from outside of the React render tree.

1. Given you have already defined a GlobalStatus in JSX:

<GlobalStatusInfoExample1 />

2. Then you can control it from within a JavaScript context whenever you need to:

<GlobalStatusInfoExampleManipulate1 />

### JSX

<GlobalStatusInfoExampleManipulate2 />

If you need an additional `GlobalStatus`, define a custom ID (custom-status):

<GlobalStatusInfoExampleManipulate3 />
