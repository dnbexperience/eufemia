## Description

`Grid.Item` is a building block for [CSS grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) based layout of contents and components. Should be used in combination with [Grid.Container](/uilib/components/grid/container/).

The columns do change based on what [breakpoint](/uilib/usage/layout/media-queries/) the browser is in:

- 4 columns when `small`
- 6 columns when `medium`
- 12 columns when `large`

### Span

You need to provide a `span` prop with a number from 1 to 12 (can be changed in [Grid.Container](/uilib/components/grid/container/) with the `columns` property).

The span will be used to specify where the item is placed in the grid columns.

A span needs always two numbers â€“ from and to.

<Examples.BasicSpan />

Example of spans:

- `span={[1, 'end']}`
- `span={{ small: [1, 4], medium: [1, 6], large: [1, 12]}}`

### Responsive spans

You can also make spans respond to media queries.

For doing so, provide a `span` prop with an object containing [Media Query](/uilib/usage/layout/media-queries/) types. Each media size should contain a span, like mentioned above.
