## Demos

### Animation during height changes

This example shows how you easily can enhance the user experience. Here we also use `showOverflow` to avoid hidden overflow during the animation.

<HeightAnimationAutosizing />

### Basic open/close

This example removes its given children, when open is `open={false}`.

<HeightAnimationDefault />

### Keep in DOM

When providing `keepInDOM={true}`, your nested content will never be removed from the DOM. But rather be "hidden" with `visually: hidden` and `aria-hidden`.

<HeightAnimationKeepInDOM />
