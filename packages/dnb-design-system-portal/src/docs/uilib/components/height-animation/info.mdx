## Import

```tsx
import { HeightAnimation } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

The HeightAnimation component calculates the height, and animates from `auto` to `auto` – or from `0` to `auto` in height – powered by CSS transition. It calculates the height on the fly.

When the animation is done, it sets the element's height to `auto`.

The component can be used as an opt-int replacement instead of vanilla HTML Elements.

The element animation is done with a CSS transition with `400ms` in duration.

It also re-calculates and changes the height, when the given content changes.

## Accessibility

It is important to never animate from 0 to e.g. 64px – because;

- the content may differ based on the viewport width (screen size)
- the content itself may change
- the user may have a larger `font-size`
