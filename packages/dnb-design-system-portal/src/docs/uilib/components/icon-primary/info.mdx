## Import

```tsx
import { IconPrimary } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

The IconPrimary component loads by default all [Primary Icons](/icons/primary) so they can easily be included and used without additionally importing every icon.

There is also the basic [Icon](/uilib/components/icon/) component, you can use for all other kinds of graphical icons.
