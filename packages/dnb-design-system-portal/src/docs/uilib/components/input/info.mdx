import * as Examples from './Examples'
import { MultipleOneRow } from '../../extensions/forms/base-fields/String/Examples'

## Import

```tsx
import { Input } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

The input component is an umbrella component for all inputs which share the same style as the classic `text` input field.

### Formatted input fields (masked values)

You may consider to use [InputMasked](/uilib/components/input-masked/) for formatted strings and [Eufemia Forms](/uilib/extensions/forms/) fields like [Number](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/Number/) and [Currency](/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields/Currency/) for formatted numbers:

<Examples.CurrencyField />

### Accessibility

Please avoid using the `maxlength` attribute when possible, as it may lower good accessibility. You can instead, use the [TextCounter](/uilib/components/fragments/text-counter/) component.

But you may also consider to use a multiline input with a `characterCounter`:

<MultipleOneRow />
