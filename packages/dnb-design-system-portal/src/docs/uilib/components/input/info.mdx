### Formatted input fields (masked values)

You may consider to use [InputMasked](/uilib/components/input-masked/) for formatted strings and [Eufemia Forms](/uilib/extensions/forms/) fields like [Field.Number](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/Number/) and [Field.Currency](/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields/Currency/) for formatted numbers:

<Examples.CurrencyField />

### Browser autofill styling

When users insert values using autofill in their browser, the browser applies its own background and text colors which overrides Eufemia's styling.

Different browsers use different color schemes. How ever, Eufemia does not overwrite the `:autofill` background color as of now. We only make sure the border (outline) is styled correctly in all the different states.

### Accessibility

Please avoid using the `maxlength` attribute when possible, as it may lower good accessibility. You can instead, use the [TextCounter](/uilib/components/fragments/text-counter/) component.

But you may also consider to use a multiline input with a `characterCounter`:

<MultipleOneRow />
