## Description

`Layout.FlexContainer` is a building block for [CSS flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) based layout of contents and components.

Ideally, use [Layout.FlexItem](/uilib/components/layout/FlexItem) or [Layout.Card](/uilib/components/layout/Card) for you inner wrappers.

## How spacing is applied

Nested components should preferable support [spacing properties](/uilib/components/space/).

When a element or component was given, that does not support it, it will still work out of the box as it gets wrapped in a spacing block.

You may else warp your custom component in a `FlexItem` – this way, you still can change the spacing per component basis.

Technically, `FlexContainer` checks if a nested component has a property called `_supportsEufemiaSpacingProps`. So if you have a component that supports the [spacing properties](/uilib/components/space/), you can add this property `ComponentName._supportsEufemiaSpacingProps = true`.

### Horizontal and Vertical aliases

For shortening the usage of `direction="..."`, you can use:

- `<Layout.Vertical>` instead of `<Layout.FlexContainer direction="vertical">`

```jsx
<Layout.Vertical>
  <Layout.FlexItem>part of vertical alignment</Layout.FlexItem>
  <Layout.FlexItem>part of vertical alignment</Layout.FlexItem>
</Layout.Vertical>
```

- `<Layout.Horizontal>` instead of `<Layout.FlexContainer direction="horizontal">`

```jsx
<Layout.Horizontal>
  <Layout.FlexItem>part of horizontal alignment</Layout.FlexItem>
  <Layout.FlexItem>part of horizontal alignment</Layout.FlexItem>
</Layout.Horizontal>
```
