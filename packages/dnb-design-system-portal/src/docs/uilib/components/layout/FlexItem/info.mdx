## Description

`Layout.FlexItem` is a building block for [CSS flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) based layout of contents and components. Should be used in combination with [FlexContainer](/uilib/components/layout/FlexContainer/).

### Size adjustment

You can provide a `size` prop with a number from 1 to 12 (can be changed in [FlexContainer](/uilib/components/layout/FlexContainer/) with the `columns` property).

The number will used to calculate a percentage unit and applied to the item via CSS.

The number 6 results in 50%, while 12 results in 100%.

### Responsive size

You can also make sizes respond to media queries.

You can provide a `size` prop with an object containing [Media Query](/uilib/usage/layout/media-queries/) types. Each size can contain a column number.

You need to ensure that `flex-wrap: wrap` is set, so the items wrap to a new line when needed. This is enabled by default in the [FlexContainer](/uilib/components/layout/FlexContainer/).
