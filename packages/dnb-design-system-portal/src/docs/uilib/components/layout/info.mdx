## Description

To make it easier to build application layout and [form](/uilib/extensions/forms)-views in line with defined design sketches, there are a number of components for layout.

```jsx
import { Layout } from '@dnb/eufemia'
render(
  <Layout.FlexContainer>
    <Layout.FlexItem>content</Layout.FlexItem>
    <Layout.FlexItem>content</Layout.FlexItem>
  </Layout.FlexContainer>,
)
```

## Layout helpers

### Flex layout

- **[FlexContainer](/uilib/components/layout/FlexContainer)** is a building block for CSS flexbox based layout of contents and components.

  - **`<Layout.Vertical>`** can be used as an alias instead of the property `direction="vertical"`.
  - **`<Layout.Horizontal>`** can be used as an alias instead of the property `direction="horizontal"`.

- **[FlexItem](/uilib/components/layout/FlexItem)** is a building block for CSS flexbox based layout of contents and components.

### Wrappers

- **[Card](/uilib/components/layout/Card)** is a block section element showing the white box with rounded gray borders, adding spacing automatically.

- **[Stack](/uilib/components/layout/Stack)** is an outer block element for wrapping content to get the correct layout and spacing between region and region headings.

### Headings

- **[MainHeading](/uilib/components/layout/MainHeading)** is a standardized main heading for sections, ensuring default layout, spacing etc.

- **[SubHeading](/uilib/components/layout/SubHeading)** is a standardized sub heading for sections, ensuring default layout, spacing etc.
