## Description

To make it easier to build application layout and [form](/uilib/extensions/forms)-views in line with defined design sketches, there are a number of components for layout.

### Wrappers

- **[Card](/uilib/components/card)** is a block section element showing the white box with rounded gray borders, adding spacing automatically.

- **[Stack](/uilib/components/layout/Stack)** is an outer block element for wrapping content to get the correct layout and spacing between region and region headings.

### Flex layout

- **[FlexContainer](/uilib/components/layout/FlexContainer)** is a building block for CSS flexbox based layout of contents and components.

  - **`<Layout.Vertical>`** can be used as an alias instead of the property `direction="vertical"`.
  - **`<Layout.Horizontal>`** can be used as an alias instead of the property `direction="horizontal"`.

- **[FlexItem](/uilib/components/layout/FlexItem)** is a building block for CSS flexbox based layout of contents and components.

### Grid layout

- **[GridContainer](/uilib/components/layout/GridContainer)** is a layout system for CSS grid based layout of contents.

- **[GridItem](/uilib/components/layout/GridItem)** is a layout system for CSS grid based layout of contents.

## Columns

UX designers are using a 12 column system, along with a 4 and 6 column system, during their design processes.

### What are the differences between Flex and Grid?

Both to support different sizing of items on different media breakpoints.

**Flex**

Uses CSS `flexbox`.

- Best suited for Forms layout.
- Can either stack vertically or horizontally.
- Can be used with any kind of children.
- Even distribution of space.
- Keeps order of items like they where given in the DOM structure.
- Items can be sized in percentage.
- When a size (percentage) is given, they stack horizontally.

```jsx
import { Layout } from '@dnb/eufemia'
render(
  <Layout.FlexContainer>
    <Layout.FlexItem>content</Layout.FlexItem>
    <OtherComponent>content</OtherComponent>
  </Layout.FlexContainer>,
)
```

**Grid**

Uses CSS `grid`.

- Best suited for applications with a column based layout.
- Columns do change between 4, 6 and 12 on the given size (media query) of the browser or screen size.
- GridContainer depends on GridItem (Item).
- Items do span from column a to b.
- Items can have different order in opposition from what's given in the DOM structure.

```jsx
import { Layout } from '@dnb/eufemia'
render(
  <Layout.GridContainer>
    <Layout.GridItem>content</Layout.GridItem>
    <Layout.GridItem>content</Layout.GridItem>
  </Layout.GridContainer>,
)
```

## Units and responsiveness

Please â€“ use `rem` instead of `px` for all of your custom CSS, and make sure;

- you always use the nearest half `rem` value, like _0.5rem_, _1rem_ or _1.5rem_ and so forth.
- you always get a **total computed height** within the grid.

This results in maintaining the integrity of the **8px** base grid.

### Exceptions

There are exceptions for when you define a "minimum" of an area, such as `min-width`. Because it will increase in size when a larger browser font-size is used. In that case, user `px` as your sizing unit.

### Smaller Units

Sometimes you may need a compensation of only a few pixels. Heres how to calculate the correct _rem_ values:

- 1px = `1/16x1` = **0.0625rem**
- 2px = `1/16x2` = **0.125rem**
- And so on ...
