## Description

To make it easier to build application layout and [form](/uilib/extensions/forms)-views in line with defined design sketches, there are a number of components for layout.

```jsx
import { Layout } from '@dnb/eufemia'
render(
  <Layout.FlexContainer direction="horizontal">
    <Layout.FlexItem>content</Layout.FlexItem>
    <Layout.FlexItem>content</Layout.FlexItem>
  </Layout.FlexContainer>,
)
```

## Layout helpers

### Flex layout

- [Layout.FlexContainer](/uilib/components/layout/FlexContainer) is a building block for CSS flexbox based layout of contents and components.

- [Layout.FlexItem](/uilib/components/layout/FlexItem) is a building block for CSS flexbox based layout of contents and components.

### Wrappers

- [Layout.Card](/uilib/components/layout/Card) is a block section element showing the white box with rounded gray borders, adding spacing automatically.

- [Layout.Stack](/uilib/components/layout/Stack) is an outer block element for wrapping content to get the correct layout and spacing between region and region headings.

### Headings

- [Layout.MainHeading](/uilib/components/layout/MainHeading) is a standardized main heading for sections, ensuring default layout, spacing etc.

- [Layout.SubHeading](/uilib/components/layout/SubHeading) is a standardized sub heading for sections, ensuring default layout, spacing etc.

## Width definitions

These are the official sizes you can use when [creating your own form fields](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/).

```css
:root {
  --layout-field-width--small: 5rem;
  --layout-field-width--medium: 11rem;
  --layout-field-width--large: 21rem;
}
```

You can also use a [Layout.FlexItem](/uilib/components/layout/FlexItem) and provide a `width="small"` prop and use it as a sized wrapper.
