## Description

To make it easier to build application layout and [form](/uilib/extensions/forms)-views in line with defined design sketches, there are a number of components for layout.

```jsx
import { Layout } from '@dnb/eufemia'
render(
  <Layout.FlexContainer>
    <Layout.FlexItem>content</Layout.FlexItem>
    <Layout.FlexItem>content</Layout.FlexItem>
  </Layout.FlexContainer>,
)
```

## Layout helpers

### Flex layout

- **[FlexContainer](/uilib/components/layout/FlexContainer)** is a building block for CSS flexbox based layout of contents and components.

  - **`<Layout.Vertical>`** can be used as an alias instead of the property `direction="vertical"`.
  - **`<Layout.Horizontal>`** can be used as an alias instead of the property `direction="horizontal"`.

- **[FlexItem](/uilib/components/layout/FlexItem)** is a building block for CSS flexbox based layout of contents and components.

### Wrappers

- **[Card](/uilib/components/layout/Card)** is a block section element showing the white box with rounded gray borders, adding spacing automatically.

- **[Stack](/uilib/components/layout/Stack)** is an outer block element for wrapping content to get the correct layout and spacing between region and region headings.

### Headings

- **[MainHeading](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/MainHeading)** is a standardized main heading for sections, ensuring default layout, spacing etc.

- **[SubHeading](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/SubHeading)** is a standardized sub heading for sections, ensuring default layout, spacing etc.

You may use the Eufemia [Layout](/uilib/components/layout/) component for your application layouts and [form](/uilib/extensions/forms)-views.

Or you may just use **CSS Flexbox** or **CSS Grid**. But please, do not use third-party layout libraries.

It is your responsibility to ensure 100% consistency and compatibility.

## Grid

UX designers are using a 12 column system, along with a 4 and 6 column system, during their design processes.

There are plans to implement support for this in the future.

## Responsiveness

In short, only use `rem` for layouts and spacing and make sure ...

- you always use the nearest half `rem` value, like _0.5rem_, _1rem_ or _1.5rem_ and so forth.
- you always get a **total computed height** within the grid.

This results in maintaining the integrity of the **8px** base grid.

### Smaller Units

Sometimes you may need a compensation of only a few pixels. Heres how to calculate the correct _rem_ values:

- 1px = `1/16x1` = **0.0625rem**
- 2px = `1/16x2` = **0.125rem**
- And so on ...
