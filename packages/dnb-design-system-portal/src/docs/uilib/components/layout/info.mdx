## Description

To make it easier to build application layout and [form](/uilib/extensions/forms)-views in line with defined design sketches, there are a number of components for layout.

```jsx
import { Layout } from '@dnb/eufemia'
render(
  <Layout.FlexContainer direction="horizontal">
    <Layout.FlexItem>content</Layout.FlexItem>
    <Layout.FlexItem>content</Layout.FlexItem>
  </Layout.FlexContainer>,
)
```

## Layout helpers

### Wrappers
