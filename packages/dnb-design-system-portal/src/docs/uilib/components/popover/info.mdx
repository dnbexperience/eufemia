## Import

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

Popover renders its own floating surface anchored to a trigger element (render function or React node) or any DOM node via `targetElement` / `targetSelector`. It manages positioning and portals internally—without relying on Tooltip—so you can safely use it alongside or even inside tooltips. Configure it with familiar props such as `position`, `align`, `arrow`, and portal settings, add an optional heading via `title`, and choose between `'light'` (default) or `'dark'` surfaces using the `theme` prop when you need it to match Tooltip’s dark background.

## Accessibility

- When you render a trigger via the provided render props, it receives ARIA attributes such as `aria-controls`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-describedby` alongside keyboard handlers.
- Focus moves into the popover body once it opens (similar to WordDefinition), and it returns to the trigger when the popover closes.
- Set `hideCloseButton` if you want to remove the built-in close button and handle dismissal yourself (use the provided `close` helper when rendering custom content).
- Focus moves inside the popover content when it opens and returns to the trigger when it closes.
- The popover can be dismissed with Escape, by clicking outside, or by using the close button.
- Custom triggers receive the necessary ARIA attributes (`aria-controls`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-describedby`) and keyboard handlers so long as you spread the provided props.
