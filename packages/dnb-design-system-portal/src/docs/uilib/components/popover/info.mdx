## Import

```tsx
import { Popover } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

**NB:** For internal use only.

Popover renders its own floating surface anchored to a trigger element.

It is used in the [Tooltip](/uilib/components/tooltip) and [DatePicker](/uilib/components/date-picker) component, but can also be used directly when you need a more flexible trigger or richer content.

## Accessibility

- Focus moves into the popover body once it opens (similar to TermDefinition), and it returns to the trigger when the popover closes.
- The Popover does by default change its alignment initially, but not reposition itself during user scroll when opened, as this could be disorienting and confusing for users.
- When you render a trigger via the provided render props, it receives ARIA attributes such as `aria-controls`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-describedby` alongside keyboard handlers.
- Set `hideCloseButton` if you want to remove the built-in close button and handle dismissal yourself (use the provided `close` helper when rendering custom content).
- Focus moves inside the popover content when it opens and returns to the trigger when it closes.
- The popover can be dismissed with Escape, by clicking outside, or by using the close button.
- Custom triggers receive the necessary ARIA attributes (`aria-controls`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-describedby`) and keyboard handlers so long as you spread the provided props.

## Root Element (React Portal)

The Popover component uses [PortalRoot](/uilib/components/portal-root) internally to render its content. See the [PortalRoot documentation](/uilib/components/portal-root) for information on how to control where the portal content appears in the DOM.
