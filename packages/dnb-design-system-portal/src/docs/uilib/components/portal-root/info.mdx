## Import

```tsx
import { PortalRoot } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

`PortalRoot` is a React component that helps you make React Portals.

It is used in other components, like [Tooltip](/uilib/components/tooltip) and [Dialog](/uilib/components/dialog).

It adds also `dnb-core-style` class to the portal element, so you don't need to deal with that yourself.

And in order to remove it from the accessibility tree, it uses `role="presentation"`. That means, when your content is visible, you need to set focus to it, so screen readers can read it.

## Usage

For invisible text content:

```tsx
import { PortalRoot } from '@dnb/eufemia'
render(<PortalRoot>Your content</PortalRoot>)
```
