## Import

```tsx
import { Radio } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

The Radio component is shown as a circle that is filled (checked) when activated.
Radio buttons are used to let a user select one option / value of a limited number of choices within a group of Radio buttons.

It is recommended to use it in a group. You can use either the React component `<Radio.Group>` or use the property `group="NAME"` to define the group.
