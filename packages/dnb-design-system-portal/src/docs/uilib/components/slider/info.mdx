## Import

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

The Slider component provides a visual indication of adjustable value. A value can be adjusted (increased or decreased) by moving the drag handle along a track (usually horizontal or vertical). Remember to inform users that they can also adjust the value directly in the value input field (if it exists).

### Define a `min` and `max` value

Keep in mind, you should most probably define your `min` and `max` value, because they are tied closely to your given value property.
