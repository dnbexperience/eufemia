## Import

```tsx
import { Slider } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

The Slider component provides a visual indication of an adjustable value. A value can be adjusted (increased or decreased) by moving the drag handle along a track (usually horizontal or vertical). Remember to inform users that they can also adjust the value directly in the value input field (if it exists).

## Accessibility

The Slider uses a semantic `<input type="range">` element for the thumb control, ensuring keyboard accessibility. Arrow keys adjust the value, and Home/End keys jump to min/max values. The current value, minimum, and maximum are announced to screen readers via `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`, and `aria-valuenow`.

### Define a `min` and `max` value

Keep in mind, you should most probably define your `min` and `max` value, because they are tied closely to your given value property.
