## Import

```tsx
import { StepIndicator } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

The step indicator (progress indicator) is a visual representation of a user's progress through a set of steps or series of actions. Their purpose is to both guide the user through the process and to help them create a mental model of the amount of time and effort that is required to fulfill the process.

If the user should be able to navigate back and forth, use the `mode="loose"` property. More about the modes further down.

The current active step is set with the `currentStep` property or within the data with the `isCurrent` object property.

**NB:** Ensure, whenever possible, to bind the `currentStep` to the browsers path location. See the [example below](/uilib/components/step-indicator/#stepindicator-with-a-router) or [the example on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/eufemia-step-indicator-with-reach-router-mhu0bh?file=/src/App.tsx).

## Modes

The mode property is mandatory. It tells the component how it should behave.

- [strict](/uilib/components/step-indicator#strict-mode)
- [loose](/uilib/components/step-indicator#loose-mode)
- [static](/uilib/components/step-indicator#static-mode)

### Strict mode

Use `strict` for a chronological step order.

The user can navigate between the visited steps and the current step. The component keeps track of these reached steps.

### Loose mode

Use `loose` if the user should be able to navigate freely between all steps. Also, those which are not visited before.

### Static mode

Use `static` for non-interactive steps.

## Modify a step

You can easily modify a step â€“ e.g. should one step not be interactive, you can use the `inactive` property on that step:

```js
const steps = [
  { title: 'Active' },
  { title: 'Not active', inactive: true },
]
```

More details about modifying steps in the [properties panel](/uilib/components/step-indicator/properties#steps-parameters).
