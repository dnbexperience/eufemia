## Description

The step indicator (progress indicator) is a visual representation of a users progress through a set of steps or series of actions. Their purpose is to both guide the user through the process and to help them create a mental model of the amount of time and effort that is required of them.

In this example we've sent the component an array of objects to simulate a scenario in a web application.

Previously visited pages will be clickable `anchor links` and unvisited/unlocked items are simply unclickable `spans`.
`activeItem` is the active indicator.
