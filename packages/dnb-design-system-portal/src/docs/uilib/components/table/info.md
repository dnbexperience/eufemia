# Tables

The following table has a default style. But in future, there will be several extensions and styles to choose from.

## Fixed layout

You may consider using `table-layout: fixed;`. You can use the modifier class in doing so: `.dnb-table--fixed`

## Accessibility

Tables do both serve as a way of navigation for screen readers and other assertive technologies. But they also help to give data an ordered structure.

Use the documentation from [MDN â€“ The Table element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) for more information on making semantic correct tables, including `scope`, `align`, `colSpan` and `rowSpan`.

## Alignment

Use e.g. `align="right"` on a `<Th>`, `<Td>` or `<Tr>` to align a table header or a table data element.
