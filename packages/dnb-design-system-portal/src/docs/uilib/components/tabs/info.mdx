## Accessibility

The Tabs component follows the [WAI-ARIA Tabs Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/). It uses `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, and `role="tabpanel"` with proper ARIA attributes. Keyboard navigation includes arrow keys to move between tabs and Tab key to navigate into the active panel content.
