## Demos

### Tag

There are three interactive tag variants:

- `clickable` (can also accept a custom icon as it does not have on of its own)
- `addable`
- `removable` (also triggers `onClick` when pressing the `Delete` or `Backspace` keyboard key (`keyup` event), can be disabled with the `omitOnKeyUpDeleteEvent` property)

We require `<Tag>`-components to be wrapped by a `<Tag.Group>`-component. The required `label`-property in `<Tag.Group>` will ensure the correct use of accessibility for screen readers.

<TagInteractable />

### Non-interactive tag

- Not interactable
- Can have icon

Non-interactable tags are simply made by skipping all callback properties, and are the only type that can have an icon.

<TagDefault />

### Non-interactive tag with icon

<TagWithIcon />

## Usage examples

### Multiple removable tags

Removable tags can for example be used in filter lists. This is a simple example on how to implement a filter list using removable `Tags`.

<TagMultipleRemovable />

### Tag used inside text

<TagInline />

### Tag used as skeleton

<TagSkeleton />
