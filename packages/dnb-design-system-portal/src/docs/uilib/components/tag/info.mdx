## Import

```tsx
import { Tag } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

The Tag is a compact element for displaying discrete information.<br/>
The component should have a clear and helpful relationship to the content or task it represents.<br/>
For example, a Tag can be used to display a category of an item.<br/>

Tags with the `onDelete`-property can be used to define an action. A clickable tag will change appearance on focus, hover, and click. <br/>
