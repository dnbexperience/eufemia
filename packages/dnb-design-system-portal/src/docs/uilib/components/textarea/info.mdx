## Description

The Textarea component is used as a multi-line text input control with an unlimited number of characters.

### Accessibility

Please avoid using the `maxlength` attribute when ever possible, as it is not accessible. Instead, use the `characterCounter` property.

This way the user gets a visual feedback of the number of characters entered and the maximum number of characters allowed. And it will not limit the user in their workflow.
