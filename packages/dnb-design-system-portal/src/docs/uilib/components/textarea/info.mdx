### Browser autofill styling

When users insert values using autofill in their browser, the browser applies its own background and text colors. However, in contrast to the [Input](/uilib/components/input/info) component, Eufemia does overwrite the `:autofill` background color because of its weird-looking gap around the writing area when autofill is used.

### Accessibility

Please avoid using the `maxlength` attribute whenever possible, as it is not accessible. Instead, use the `characterCounter` property.

This way the user gets a visual feedback of the number of characters entered and the maximum number of characters allowed. And it will not limit the user in their workflow.

You still can still set the requirement of your desired maximum number of characters by setting the `maxLength` property in [Eufemia Forms](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String/).
