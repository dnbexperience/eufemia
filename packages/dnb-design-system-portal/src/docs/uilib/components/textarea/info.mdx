### Browser autofill styling

When users insert values using autofill in their browser, the browser applies its own background and text colors. However, in contrast to the [Input](/uilib/components/input/info) component, Eufemia overwrites the `:autofill` background color to avoid a visually inconsistent gap around the writing area when autofill is used.

### Accessibility

Please avoid using the `maxlength` attribute whenever possible, as it is not accessible. Instead, use the `characterCounter` property.

This way, the user gets visual feedback on the number of characters entered and the maximum number of characters allowed, and it will not limit the user in their workflow.

You can still set the requirement for your desired maximum number of characters by setting the `maxLength` property in [Eufemia Forms](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String/).
