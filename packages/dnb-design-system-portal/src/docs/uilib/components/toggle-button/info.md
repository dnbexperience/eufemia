## Description

The ToggleButton component should be used to toggle on or off a limited number of choices.

You can use the React component `<ToggleButton.Group>` to wrap several `ToggleButton`. This makes it more easy to handle the event `on_change` on a higher level - as well as several other [context related properties](uilib/components/toggle-button/properties).

By default the `ToggleButton.Group` is single-select, like a [Radio](/uilib/components/radio) button. But You can easily enable `multiselect` as well.
