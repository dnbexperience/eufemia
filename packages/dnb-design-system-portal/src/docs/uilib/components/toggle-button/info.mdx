You can use the React component `<ToggleButton.Group>` to wrap several `ToggleButton` components. This makes it easier to handle the `onChange` event at a higher level, as well as several other [context-related properties](/uilib/components/toggle-button/properties).

By default, the `ToggleButton.Group` is single-select, like a [Radio](/uilib/components/radio) button. However, you can easily enable `multiselect` as well.

## How to use

You can use the ToggleButton in different modes. Either as a stand-alone component or together with the `ToggleButton.Group` context.

### Multi-select

If `multiselect` is enabled on the group, several items can be enabled or disabled by the user.

You need to decide if you want to track the state yourself by using the `checked` property, or if you want to listen to the internal state with `onChange(({ values }) => console.log(values))`. In this case, you also need to give every item a `value` property.
