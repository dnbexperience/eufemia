### Tooltip accessibility problems

Because a Tooltip is often bound to a hover action, there are cases where you as a developer, together with a UX designer, need to find alternative ways of supporting access to that information.

The Tooltip component is integrated e.g. in the Button component. This way, we can handle the tooltip information to be accessible for screen readers.

#### Touch devices and keyboard support

In order to enhance accessibility for these targets, we add a `tabindex="0"` as well as a `touchstart` event handler.

## Links (anchor) with target blank

The Eufemia Anchor and Button components do show the Tooltip component when the url target is set to `_blank` in order to enhance accessibility about the action of opening a new window (out of context).

## Controlled active

When you pass the `active` property, the Tooltip becomes controlled:

- `active={true}`: The tooltip stays visible and ignores DOM events (hover, focus, touch). It will not auto-hide on `mouseleave`.
- `active={false}`: The tooltip stays hidden and ignores DOM events. It will not auto-show on `mouseenter` or focus.

To use the built-in hover/focus/touch behavior, omit the `active` property and let the component manage visibility internally.
