### Tooltip accessibility problems

Because a Tooltip is often bound to a hover action, there are cases where you as a developer, together with a UX designer, need to find alternative ways of supporting access to that information.

The Tooltip component is integrated e.g. in the [Button](/uilib/components/button) component. This way, we can handle the tooltip information to be accessible for screen readers.

- All content inside the Tooltip can be selected when it is open.
- When the mouse moves over the Tooltip content, the Tooltip remains open.
- Custom triggers receive the necessary ARIA attributes (`aria-describedby`) so assistive technologies can announce the tooltip content without hovering.

#### Touch devices and keyboard support

In order to enhance accessibility for touch devices, we add a `tabindex="0"` as well as a `touchstart` event handler.

## Links (anchor) with target blank

The Eufemia [Anchor](/uilib/components/anchor) and [Button](/uilib/components/button) components do show the Tooltip component when the url target is set to `_blank` in order to enhance accessibility about the action of opening a new window (out of context).

## Controlled active

When you pass the `active` property, the Tooltip becomes controlled:

- `active={true}`: The Tooltip stays visible and ignores DOM events (hover, focus, touch). It will not auto-hide on `mouseleave`.
- `active={false}`: The Tooltip stays hidden and ignores DOM events. It will not auto-show on `mouseenter` or focus.

To use the built-in hover/focus/touch behavior, omit the `active` property and let the component manage visibility internally.
