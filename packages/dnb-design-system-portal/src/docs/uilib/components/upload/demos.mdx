## Demos

### Upload (default)

<UploadBasic />

### 'useUpload' React Hook

By using the `Upload.useUpload` you can remove or add files or the status displayed in the component.

You can also use the file blob in combination with the [FileReader](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_API) API.

<UploadRemoveFile />

### Upload single file/fixed amount of files

<UploadSingleFile />

### Upload loading state

When uploading the file you can set the loading state of the request using the `Upload.useUpload` hook and passing `isLoading` to the file that is being uploaded.

<UploadIsLoading />

### Upload error message

The only file verification the Upload component does is for the file size and the file type. These errors are handled by the HTML element `input` so they aren't selectable. If you want any other error messages you can use the `Upload.useUpload` hook the same way as with the loading state.

<UploadErrorMessage />

### Upload specific accepted file formats

You can pass the file formats as a string array. This will restrict which files that can be selected.

<UploadAcceptedFormats />

### Upload with prefilled error

<UploadPrefilledFileList />
