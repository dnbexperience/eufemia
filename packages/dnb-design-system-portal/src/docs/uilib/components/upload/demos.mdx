## Demos

### Upload (default)

<UploadBasic />

### 'useUpload' React Hook

By using the `Upload.useUpload` you can remove or add files or the status displayed in the component.

You can also use the file blob in combination with the [FileReader](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_API) API.

<UploadRemoveFile />

### Upload single file/fixed amount of files

<UploadSingleFile />

### Upload loading state

When uploading the file you can set the loading state of the request using the `Upload.useUpload` hook and passing `isLoading` to the file that is being uploaded.

<UploadIsLoading />

### Upload error message

The only file verification the Upload component does is for the file size and the file type. These errors are handled by the HTML element `input` so they aren't selectable. If you want any other error messages you can use the `Upload.useUpload` hook the same way as with the loading state.

<UploadErrorMessage />

### Upload specific accepted file formats

You can pass the file formats as a string array. This will restrict which files that can be selected.

<UploadAcceptedFormats />

### Upload with prefilled error

<UploadPrefilledFileList />

### Upload with file max size based on file type

<UploadFileMaxSizeBasedOnFileType />

### Upload without file max size, and custom error handling of file size

You can disable the file max size, which will deactivate all file size verifications in the Upload component.
This can also be used to manually implement more complex file max size verifications, like file max size based on file type, see the example below:

<VisibleWhenNotVisualTest>
  <UploadDisabledFileMaxSize />
</VisibleWhenNotVisualTest>
