## How to use the Upload component

- Files selected by the user should be uploaded immediately (temporary location).
- The user should be able to remove them (files) during the session.
- The Upload component connects to the [GlobalStatus](/uilib/components/global-status) and displays file error messages there as well.
- Validation messages coming from the "backend" should be displayed for each file via the `useUpload` hook. See [example](/uilib/components/upload/#upload-error-message) below.
- The `useUpload` hook can be placed in any location in your application, and does not need to be where the `Upload` component is used.

```jsx
function YourComponent() {
  const myUploadId = 'unique-id' // or a function, object or React Context reference
  const { files, setFiles } = Upload.useUpload(myUploadId)

  React.useEffect(() => {
    setFiles(
      files.map((fileItem) => {
        if (fileItem.file.name === fileNameFromBackend) {
          fileItem.errorMessage = 'Your message from the backend'
        }
        return fileItem
      }),
    )
  }, [fileNameFromBackend])

  return <Upload id={myUploadId} />
}
```

## `useUpload` hook

Exposes the following functionality:

- `files`: the given files of the Upload component.
- `setFiles`: a function to set the files of the Upload component.
- `clearFiles`: a function to reset the files (also internal files used to display the warning errorAmountLimit) of the Upload component.

## Variant compact

The `compact` variant displays less information than the `normal` variant, and aims to only display the most necessary for the user to be able to upload a file. Which is the:

- Upload button
- List of uploaded files
- `title` as label (can be removed by providing the value `false`)
- `text` as sublabel (can be removed by providing the value `false`)

It does not display info about:

- `filesAmountLimit`
- `fileMaxSize`
- `acceptedFileTypes`

## JPG vs JPEG

When `jpg` is defined (most commonly used), then the component will also accept `jpeg` files.

## Backend integration

The "backend" receiving the files is decoupled and can be any existing or new system.

## Limit the amount of files

By default, the Upload component accepts multiple files. You can use the property `filesAmountLimit={1}` to make the component accept only one file.

## Page wide drop support

Once the Upload component mounts, it also adds support for dropping files to the entire browser body.

**NB:** When you have several mounted components, only the first Upload component will receive the dropped files.

## The `download` property

Each file item is displayed as a clickable link with its original file name, which opens the file source in a new browser tab.

In some situations, it's more suitable to have each link download the file instead of opening it in a new browser tab. To achieve this, set the `download={true}` property on the Upload component.

## Prevents uploading duplicate files

By default, the Upload component prevents uploading duplicate files.
It determines if a file is duplicate if the file's `name`, `size` (if existing), and `lastModified` (if existing) values are equal.
You can use the property `allowDuplicates={true}` to make the component allow duplicate files.
