## Description

`VisuallyHidden` is a utility component that can be used to hide its children visually, while keeping them visible to screen readers and other assistive technology.

NOTE: Many semantic elements, such as button elements, have meaning to assistive devices and browsers that provide context for the user and, in many cases, provide or restrict interactive behaviors. Use caution when overriding our defaults and make sure that the element you choose to render provides the same experience for all users. In short: The component shouldn’t be used to hide interactive content.
