## Accessibility

To ensure that the WordDefinition component is accessible, it uses semantic HTML elements and appropriate ARIA attributes.

- All content inside the WordDefinition can be selected when it is open.
- Clicking anywhere outside the WordDefinition, or pressing Escape, closes it.
- The trigger looks like an [Anchor](/uilib/components/anchor) but is actually a semantic button.
- It is fully focusable and works with keyboard navigation.
- The trigger is aligned to the left side of the word for better readability (not centered).
- Screen readers read the word (its children) first and then announce that the trigger can be activated to show more information.
- When the WordDefinition opens, it receives focus and the screen reader announces its content.
- When it closes, focus returns to the trigger so keyboard users keep their place in the document.
- The close button is placed last in the tab order, making it easy for keyboard users to reach after reading the content.
- It also closes automatically when focus moves outside the WordDefinition or when the Escape key is pressed.
- The trigger shows the hover style of an [Anchor](/uilib/components/anchor) when open.
