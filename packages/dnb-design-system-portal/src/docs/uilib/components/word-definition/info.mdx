## Accessibility

To ensure that the WordDefinition component is accessible, it uses semantic HTML elements and appropriate ARIA attributes.

- The content is fully selectable.
- Clicking outside the tooltip or pressing Escape closes the tooltip.
- The trigger element is visually styled as a link but behaves as a button.
- It is focusable and usable with keyboard navigation.
- The trigger announces that it can be activated to reveal more information, while the “word” (its children) is read first by screen readers.
- When the tooltip opens, it receives focus and the screen reader announces the tooltip content.
- The close button appears last in the tab order so keyboard users can easily reach it after reading the tooltip content.
