## Important aspects

- PropTypes are getting [wrapped with]([this babel plugin](babel-plugin-transform-react-remove-prop-types)) `process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"`. This way applications in production, will not include `propTypes`. If a component depends to check `propTypes` during runtime, consider to export them, so they not getting removed â€“ or simply use `defaultProps` for the operation.
- As for now, we use React Class Components, because there may happen the case, where two React instances are used, and that does not work with Hooks. Also performance is a key factor. But we may considder a rewrite at some point of time.
