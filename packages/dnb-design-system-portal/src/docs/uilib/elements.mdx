# HTML Elements

The `@dnb/eufemia` contains styling for the most commonly used [HTML Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) defined by the UX team at DNB. You may also have a look at [Typography](/uilib/typography) for headings and paragraph usage.

## Elements

<ListSummaryFromPages returnListItems slug="uilib/elements/" />

### Vanilla HTML

In order to apply a style, you have to define a CSS class, like:

```jsx
<a href="/" className="dnb-anchor">Text Link</a>
<blockquote className="dnb-blockquote">
  Dis leo ala tractatos ei quo.
</blockquote>
```

### React JSX

For those using JSX with React, you can simply use the wrapper Components. They also inherit to the [Skeleton](/uilib/components/skeleton) provider.

```jsx
import { H1, H2, P, Anchor, Link } from '@dnb/eufemia/elements'

render(
  <article>
    <H1>Semantic h1</H1>
    <P>My Paragraph</P>
    <Anchor href="/">Link</Anchor>
    <Link href="/">Link</Link>
  </article>
)
```

#### Styled Components

They work seamlessly with Styled Components (emotion) as well:

<StyledComponentsExample />

## Unstyled HTML Elements

In order to use the inherited [Skeleton](/uilib/components/skeleton), there are a number of un-styled HTML elements, that do inherit and react to the Skeleton Provider.

```jsx
import { Span, Div } from '@dnb/eufemia/elements'
```

- `Span`
- `Div`

### Example usage of span

<UnstyledExample />

## Missing HTML Elements

Not every commonly used HTML Elements are included yet in the `@dnb/eufemia`. This decision is made by the DNB UX Team and relies on a principle to make UX design as good as possible, consistent and more thoughtful towards a broader customer target.

- For the `select` element, use the [**Dropdown**](/uilib/components/dropdown) component.
