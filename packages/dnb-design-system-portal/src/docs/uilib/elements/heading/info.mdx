## Description

Eufemia comes with three levels of heading styles:

- `.dnb-h--xx-large` (Heading xx-large)
- `.dnb-h--x-large` (Heading x-large)
- `.dnb-h--large` (Heading large)

Additional, you can use these style modifiers if needed:

- `.dnb-h--medium`
- `.dnb-h--basis`
- `.dnb-h--small`
- `.dnb-h--x-small`

Optional, you could use `.dnb-lead` (equivalent to `.dnb-h--medium`) to style a heading as well. But only if that would make sense in the particular context.

The sizes are aligned to the [font-size definitions](/uilib/typography/font-size).

## Think semantics first

You should [think semantics first](/uilib/usage/best-practices/for-typography#headings-and-styling) once you choose what level of heading you use. Always try to start with an `<h1>`. When the heading levels are properly defined, you can go ahead and define the sizes (styles).

If you have to use a paragraph (`<p>`) or a arbitrary heading, and it has to **look like** a specific heading, you can use these classes:

- `.dnb-h--xx-large`
- `.dnb-h--x-large`
- `.dnb-h--large`
- etc.

## Automated heading levels

There is also [Heading](/uilib/components/heading), a component to create automated semantic headings within a boundary of some rules.

```jsx
import { Heading } from '@dnb/eufemia/components'
```

## Heading styles in React

```jsx
import { H1, H2, ... } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```
