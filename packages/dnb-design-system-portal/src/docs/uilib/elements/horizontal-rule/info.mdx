## Import

```tsx
import { Hr } from '@dnb/eufemia/elements'
```

## Description

The `<hr />` tag in HTML stands for horizontal rule and is used to insert a horizontal rule or a thematic break in an HTML page to divide or separate document sections. The `<hr />` tag is an empty tag and it does not require an end tag.

## Customize hr color

```css
/* Example of how to change the line color */
.dnb-hr {
  --hr-color: var(--color-ocean-green);
}
```

## Horizontal Rule thickness tests

Browsers do render borders differently. They also handle sizing differently. E.g. will `1.5px` be rounded up to `2px` in Chromium based browsers (on size related CSS properties).

In order to address different solutions, [here is a test case](https://r8ljo.csb.app/), finding the right balance of creating `0.5px` / `1.5px` lines, browser compatibility and correct look. As per year 2020, Firefox does the best job on showing the line thickness correct.
