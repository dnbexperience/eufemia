# Image

The image element associated with the class `dnb-img` does not have much opinionated styling. It exists more to have a future possibility to optimize and add features.

The React image "element" (Img) does provide a `figure` element with an `img` element inside. This is mainly to support a `caption` text and a [Skeleton](/uilib/components/skeleton).

```jsx
import { Img } from '@dnb/eufemia'

render(<Img alt="..." src="..." width="100" height="100" />)
```

## Image with invalid source
