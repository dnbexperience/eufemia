## Description

The image element associated with the class `dnb-img` does not have much opinionated styling. It exists more to have a future possibility to optimize and add features.

As of now, the React image "element" (Img) does provide a `figure` element with the `role="img"` and an `img` tag inside. This is mainly to support the [Skeleton](/uilib/components/skeleton) provider.

```jsx
import { Img } from '@dnb/eufemia'

render(<InlineImg alt="..." src="..." width="100" height="100" />)
```
