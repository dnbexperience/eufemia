## Import

```tsx
import { Img } from '@dnb/eufemia/elements'
```

## Description

The image element associated with the class `dnb-img` does not have much opinionated styling. It exists to provide a future possibility to optimize and add features.

As of now, the React image "element" (Img) provides a `figure` element with the `role="img"` and an `img` tag inside. This is mainly to support the [Skeleton](/uilib/components/skeleton) provider.
