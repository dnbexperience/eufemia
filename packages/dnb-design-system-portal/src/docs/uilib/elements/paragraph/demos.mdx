### Paragraphs modifiers

These are the standard available modifiers for paragraph typography:

- [Weight](#weight)
- [Size](#size)
- [Alignment](#alignment)
- [Font family](#font-family)
- [Line height](#line-height)

As well as some [other modifiers](#other-modifiers).

#### Weight

<ParagraphWeightModifiers />

#### Size

Also automatically sets the matching line-height (`line` property).

<ParagraphSizeModifiers />

#### Alignment

<ParagraphAlignmentModifiers />

#### Font family

<ParagraphFamilyModifiers />

#### Line height

Line-height will be set automatically based on the `size` properties, but can also be set separately if needed.

<ParagraphLineHeightModifiers />

#### Other modifiers

Although bold, italic and underline are not a standard part of the Eufemia design system for typography (in particular, "medium" should be used instead of "bold"), we still include them as an option for convenience. And there are also cases where an accessibility case can be made for their use.

#### Prose max width

The `proseMaxWidth` prop allows you to limit the width of paragraph text based on character count, creating optimal reading line lengths:

<ParagraphProseMaxWidth />

### Children tag styling

Paragraph also adds some default styling to child typography HTML elements. Like `<b>` or `<strong>`.

#### Paragraphs `basis` sized

<ParagraphDefault />

##### Paragraph `small` sized

<ParagraphSmall />

##### Additional Paragraph formatting (not defined yet)

<ParagraphAdditional />
