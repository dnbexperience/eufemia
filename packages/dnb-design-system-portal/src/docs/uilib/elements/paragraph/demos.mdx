### Paragraphs modifiers

These are the standard available modifiers for paragraph typography:

- [Weight](#weight)
- [Size](#size)
- [Alignment](#alignment)
- [Font family](#font-family)
- [Line height](#line-height)

As well as some [other modifiers](#other-modifiers).

#### Weight

<ParagraphWeightModifiers />

#### Size

Also automatically sets the matching line-height (`line` prop).

<ParagraphSizeModifiers />

#### Alignment

<ParagraphAlignmentModifiers />

#### Font family

<ParagraphFamilyModifiers />

#### Line height

Line-height will be set automatically based on the `size` props, but can also be set seperately if needed.

<ParagraphLineHeightModifiers />

#### Other modifiers

Although bold, italic and underline are not a standard part of the Eufemia design system for typography (in particular, "medium" should be used instead of "bold"), we still include them as an option for convenience. And there are also cases where an accessibility case can be made for their use.

#### Paragraphs `basis` sized

<ParagraphDefault />

##### Paragraph `small` sized
