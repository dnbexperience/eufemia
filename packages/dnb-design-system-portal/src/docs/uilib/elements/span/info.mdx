## Import

```tsx
import { Span } from '@dnb/eufemia/elements'
```

## Description

`<Span>` are inline elements. They share typography props (for size and weight) with the [Paragraph component](/uilib/elements/paragraph).
Unlike `<P>`, the `<Span>` component does not modify anything by default.

Since `<Span>` is an inline element, it's easier to modify parts of text than it is with `<P>`.
