# Extensions

## Description

Eufemia extensions are reusable parts that do not fit naturally in to a component or element, but rather has the nature of being an extended solution of Eufemia.
There are several great reasons for having extensions seperated:

- Tree shaking?
- Great reason #2?
- Great reson #3?

### Import extensions

```js
import { ... } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions'
```

### Import extensions styles

The styles for extensions are not a part of the default styles, so you have to import them explicitly.

```js
import '@dnb/eufemia/style/themes/theme-ui/extensions'
```
