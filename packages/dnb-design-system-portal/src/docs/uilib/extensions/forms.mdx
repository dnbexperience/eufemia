## Philosophy

Eufemia Forms is:

- A framework for building form features
- Flexibility by design
- Data-driven API
- Standardized data handling
- Loosely coupled components and building blocks
- Focus on superior user experience, accessibility, and usability

Eufemia Forms is a set of building blocks for form functionality. Components are built on an API with standardized sets of props that make it easier to combine with surrounding data flow, and not least to create your own components that work well together with the ready-made components in Eufemia Forms.

An important point is that the components are data-driven. They are built on the premise of the source data, rather than being closely coupled to HTML elements that the internal implementation uses.

## Features

Eufemia Forms consists of reusable components for data input, data display and surrounding layout for simplified user interface creation in React, built on top of base Eufemia components.

In summary:

- Ready to use data driven form components.
- Three shakeable structure. Unused code will not be included in the production bundle.
- All functionality in all components can be controlled and overridden via props.
- Data management using the declarative [JSON Pointer](/uilib/extensions/forms/getting-started/#what-is-a-json-pointer) directive (i.e `path="/firstName"`).
- State can be handled outside of the [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/Handler) (Provider Context) with the [useData](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/useData) hook.
- Validation (like `minLength` on text fields) as well as advanced and complex [Ajv](https://ajv.js.org/) JSON schema validator (Ajv is like Joi or Yup â€“ check out [some examples](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/#schema-validation)) support on both single fields and the whole data set.
- Async form [submission](/uilib/extensions/forms/getting-started/#async-form-behavior) and [validation](/uilib/extensions/forms/getting-started/#async-validation) support.
- Theming of field sizes with [Form.Appearance](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/Appearance/).
- Static [value components](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Value/) for displaying data with proper formatting.
- Building blocks for [creating your custom field components](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component).

### Basic field usage

Components in Eufemia Forms are very flexible. They adapt to the set of props they receive, and you can therefore choose which parts of the functionality they consist of that you use, and what you yourself want to handle in the application code.

Here is an example that consists of a large degree of data handling in the application, even though the form itself still consists of both components from Eufemia and local special components (the blue boxes):

<div style={{ maxWidth: '1200px' }}>
  <InlineImg
    height="auto"
    width="auto"
    src={FormDiagram1}
    caption="Simple form example with Eufemia Forms fields"
  />
</div>

### Complete state management and local custom fields

In this example, all state data, validation process and error handling are done by components from Eufemia Forms, while in a local field component created especially for this application, there is a combination of standardized field functionality taken from Eufemia Forms, and local special code to achieve the goal of maximum reuse without sacrificing flexibility:

<div style={{ maxWidth: '1200px' }}>
  <InlineImg
    height="auto"
    width="auto"
    src={FormDiagram2}
    caption="Complete state management and local custom fields"
  />
</div>

## First steps

You import the components from with scopes, such as `Form` and `Field`:

```jsx
import { Form, Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

render(
  <Form.Handler onSubmit={console.log}>
    <Field.String label="Custom Field" />
    <Form.ButtonRow>
      <Form.SubmitButton />
    </Form.ButtonRow>
  </Form.Handler>,
)
```

## Create your own components

Eufemia Forms consists of helper components and tools so you can declaratively create interactive form components that flawlessly integrates between existing data and your custom form components. This ensures a common look and feel, even when ready-made components are combined with your local custom components.

Read more about on how to [create your own component](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component).

## Requirements

Some of the internal logic requires support for importing JSON files. Meta frameworks do often support this by default.
