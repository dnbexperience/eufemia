## Demos

### Without Form.Handler

<Examples.WithoutDataContext />

### With a nested path

This lets you reuse the same block of fields in multiple places in your forms.

<Examples.NestedPathBlock />

### Overwrite props

Overwriting props makes it very flexible to reuse the same block of fields in multiple places in your forms.

<Examples.OverwriteProps />

### Schema support

This feature lets you extend the requirements of the fields in the block with a [JSON Schema](/uilib/extensions/forms/all-features/#schema-validation).

<Examples.SchemaSupport />

### Required support

You can easily make a block of fields required by setting the `required` prop on the block itself.

<Examples.AllFieldsRequired />

### With Visibility logic

The [Visibility](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Visibility/) component lets you show or hide parts of your form based on the data given in the block itself.

<Examples.WithVisibility />
