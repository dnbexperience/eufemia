# DataContext.Context

The main context for [DataContext.Provider](/uilib/extensions/forms/DataContext/Provider) which the [DataInput](/uilib/extensions/forms/DataInput/) and [DataValue](/uilib/extensions/forms/DataValue/) components connect to (optional) for sources and callbacks when it is present. It can be used for creating custom components in similar ways.
