## Description

`DataContext.Provider` is the context provider that has to wrap the features if components of Field and Value is to be used with a common source instead of distributing values and events individually.

For a more complete feature set tailored to building forms, please use [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler). It uses DataContext internally.

```tsx
import { DataContext } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(
  <DataContext.Provider data={existingData}>...</DataContext.Provider>,
)
```
