## Basic input components

Data input consists of basic components that are designed to receive user input that will end up in the form of primitive data types, such as `string`, `number` and `boolean`:

<ListBaseComponents />

## Feature-specific input components

In addition to the basic input components, the package offers a number of input components that are more closely tailored to the business logic we need in our applications.

Although these mostly reuse the basic components internally, they prevent you from having to provide a number of boilerplate props such as syntax rules, field labels and validation error messages. All props can still be overridden individually if necessary.

The following input components exist:

<ListFeatureComponents />
