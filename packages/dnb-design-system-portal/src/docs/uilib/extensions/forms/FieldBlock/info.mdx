## Description

`FieldBlock` is the reusable wrapper for building [Field-components](/uilib/extensions/forms/Field). It shows surrounding elements through properties from `FieldProps` like `label` and `error`, and ensure that spacing between different fields work as required when put into surrounding components like `FlexContainer` or `Card`.
