### Outset

`<Form.Card>` will "outsets" (break out) from the layout using negative margins to preserve content alignment in forms.

This outset is turned off if it is placed inside a `<Card>` (or another `<Form.Card>`) to avoid overlapping margins/padding/borders, but if placed in a different wrapper that messes with the layout, you can manually turn it off in two ways:

- Wrap it in `<Form.Card.Provider disableCardBreakout>` to make all nested `<Form.Card>` act like they’re inside a `<Card>` (stay contained in the parent content area on all screen sizes).
- Or set `outset={false}` on each card (only affects medium and large screen sizes).
