## Import

```tsx
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Form.Card />)
```

## Description

`Form.Card` is a wrapper for the [Card](/uilib/components/card/) component to make it easier to use inside a form:

- It will set `outset` to `true` by default (instead of `false`). [See example below.](#outset)
- It will set `stack` to `true` by default (instead of `false`).

But in all other ways, it works just like the [Card](/uilib/components/card/) component.
