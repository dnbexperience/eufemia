## Description

`Form.Card` is a wrapper for the [Card](/uilib/components/card/) component to make it easier to use inside a form.

- It will set `outset` to `true` by default (instead of `false`).
- It will set `stack` to `true` by default (instead of `false`).

But it otherwise identical to the `<Card>` component.
