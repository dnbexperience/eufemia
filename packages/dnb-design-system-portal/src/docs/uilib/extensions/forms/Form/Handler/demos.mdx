## Demos

### In combination with a SubmitButton

This example uses an async `onSubmit` event handler. It will disable all fields and show an indicator on the [SubmitButton](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/SubmitButton/) while the form is pending.

With an async function, you can also handle the response from the server and update the form with the new data.

```ts
// Async function
const onSubmit = async (data) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    })
    const data = await response.json()
    Form.setData('unique', data) // Whatever you want to do with the data
  } catch (error) {
    return error // Will display the error message in the form
  }
}
```

### New location after async submit

This example is only for demo purpose and will NOT redirect to a new location. It will also time out after 10 seconds.

<Examples.AsyncSubmitComplete />

### Filter your data

By using the `filterSubmitData` prop you can filter out data that you don't want to send to your server.

It will filter out data from the `onSubmit` event property.

In this example we filter out all fields that are disabled.

<Examples.FilterData />

### With session storage

Changes you make to the fields are temporarily saved and loaded
when the browser reloads. The data is stored until the session storage is invalidated.

### Locale and translations

### Autocomplete (autofill) user data

### Complex async (autosave) example

This example demonstrates how to use async validation with an async `onSubmit` and async `onChange` event for both the `Form.Handler` and a field itself.

- While you write, an async validation request is simulated to check if the input is valid. If it's not, an error message will be shown.

- During validation, only the relevant value will be evaluated. This means, when the delayed validation is done, and the value has changed, the validation result will be omitted.

- You can press enter to submit the form while you write. But only a string of `valid` will be accepted to emit the form `onSubmit` and `onChange`.

- You can start writing, wait a second or two and remove the whole text again and blur the field. The async validation return will be omitted and the "required" error message will be shown.

- It also shows some status messages after the validation and submit requests are done.

- This example does not include an async `onBlurValidator` – but it's possible to add one into the mix as well.

- To access the `date` "in sync" – you can use the [useData](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/useData/) hook.
