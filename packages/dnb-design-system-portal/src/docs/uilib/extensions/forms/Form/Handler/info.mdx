## Description

The `Form.Handler` component provides a HTML form element.

```jsx
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(
  <Form.Handler
    data={existingData}
    onChange={...}
    onSubmit={...}
  >
    Your Form
  </Form.Handler>,
)
```

The form data can be handled outside of the form. This is useful if you want to use the form data in other components:

```jsx
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
function Component() {
  const {
    getValue, // Method to get a single value
    update, // Method to update a single value
    set, // Method to set the whole dataset
    data, // The whole dataset (unvalidated)
    filterData, // Method to filter data with your own logic
  } = Form.useData('unique')

  return <Form.Handler id="unique">...</Form.Handler>
}
```

More examples can be found in the [useData](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/useData/) hook docs.

## Async `onChange` and `onSubmit` event handlers

**NB:** When using an async `onChange` event handler, the `data` parameter will only include validated data. This lets you utilize the `data` parameter directly in your request, without having to further process or transform it.

If you need to use the original data (sync), you can access it via the [useData](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/useData/) hook.

Depending on your needs, you may want to use e.g. `debounceAsync` ([debounce](/uilib/helpers/functions/#debounce)) to prevent multiple requests from being sent.

You can return parameters from inside the async `onChange` or `onSubmit` event handler. This way you can display more related information, such as an error or an object with these keys:

<AsyncChangeExample />

<AsyncStateReturnExample />

The `info`, `warning` and `error` messages will be displayed at the bottom of a form or field ([FormStatus](/uilib/components/form-status)), depending where it is used. While the `success` will be displayed on the label of the field that initiated the `onChange` event.

## Browser autofill

You can set `autoComplete` on the `Form.Handler` – each [Field.String](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String/)-field will then get `autoComplete="on"`:

```tsx
<Form.Handler autoComplete={true}>
  <Field.String path="/firstName" />
  <Field.String path="/lastName" />
</Form.Handler>
```

The `path` property will be used to set the `name` attribute, which lets browser know which autocomplete value should be proposed to the user.

## Temporary storage

The `sessionStorageId` feature uses the browsers session-storage (temporary storage mechanism) to store data entered by the user.

This lets the user navigate away and come back to the form, without loosing already entered data.

Ensure you only use this feature for non-sensitive data.

It will flush the storage once the form gets submitted.

## Filter data

You can use the `filterSubmitData` method to filter your `onSubmit` data.

Useless could be to exclude disabled fields or to filter out empty fields.

The callback function receives the following arguments:

1. `path` as the first argument.
2. `value` as the second argument.
3. The field `properties` (props) as the third argument.
4. The fourth argument is an object with the internal state of the field, like the error state.

The callback function should return a `boolean` or `undefined`. Return `false` to exclude an entry.

It returns the filtered form data.

The [useData](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/useData/#filter-data) hook and the [getData](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/getData/#filter-data) method also returns a `filterData` function you can use to filter data the same way.

Down below is an example of how to use the `filterSubmitData` method.
