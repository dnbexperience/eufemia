## Description

`ViewContainer` enables users to toggle (with animation) the content of each item between this view and the [EditContainer](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Section/EditContainer/) container.

By default, it features the toolbar containing a "Edit" button.

```tsx
import { Form, Field, Value } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

render(
  <Form.Section>
    <Form.Section.EditContainer title="Edit account holder">
      <Field.Name.Last path="/name" />
    </Form.Section.EditContainer>

    <Form.Section.ViewContainer title="Account holder">
      <Value.Name.Last path="/name" />
    </Form.Section.ViewContainer>
  </Form.Section>,
)
```

## Accessibility

The `ViewContainer` component has an `aria-label` attribute, which is set to the `title` prop value. It uses a section element to wrap the content, which helps users with screen readers to get the needed announcement.

When the item (view and edit) container gets removed, the active element focus will be set on the previous item.
