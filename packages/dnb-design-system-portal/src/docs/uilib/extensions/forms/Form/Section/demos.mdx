## Demos

### Without Form.Handler

<Examples.WithoutDataContext />

### With a nested path

This lets you reuse the same section of fields in multiple places in your forms.

<Examples.NestedPathSection />

### With a Edit and View container

This example uses the [EditContainer](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Section/EditContainer/) and [ViewContainer](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Section/ViewContainer/) containers with the default `variant="outline"`.

<Examples.ViewAndEditContainer />

### Show errors on the whole section

When a field in the section has an error and the section has `containerMode` set to `auto` (default), the whole section will switch to edit mode. The errors will be shown when `validateInitially` is set to `true`.

<Examples.ViewAndEditContainerValidation />

Using `variant="basic"` will render the view and edit container without the additional Card `outline`.

<Examples.BasicViewAndEditContainer />

### Overwrite props

Overwriting props makes it very flexible to reuse the same section of fields in multiple places in your forms.

<Examples.OverwriteProps />

### Schema support

This feature lets you extend the requirements of the fields in the section with a [JSON Schema](/uilib/extensions/forms/all-features/#schema-validation).

<Examples.SchemaSupport />

### Required support

You can easily make a section of fields required by setting the `required` prop on the section itself.

<Examples.AllFieldsRequired />

### Nested sections

You can nest sections inside each other.

<Examples.NestedSections />

### With Visibility logic

The [Visibility](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Visibility/) component lets you show or hide parts of your form based on the data given in the section itself.

<Examples.WithVisibility />
