## Description

`Form.SubmitConfirmation` can be used to prevent the [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/) from submitting, and makes it possible to show a confirmation dialog in different scenarios.

```jsx
import { Dialog } from '@dnb/eufemia'
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(
  <Form.Handler
    onSubmit={async () => {
      // Your submit request
    }}
  >
    Content...
    <Form.SubmitButton />
    <Form.SubmitConfirmation
      preventSubmitWhen={(submitState) => {
        // Your preventSubmitWhen logic
      }}
      onStateChange={(parameters) => {
        // Your onStateChange logic
      }}
      renderWithState={(parameters) => {
        return 'Your content'
      }}
    />
  </Form.Handler>,
)
```

The `renderWithState` function is called whenever the submit confirmation state changes. It receives an object as the first parameter, which contains:

- `connectWithDialog` lets you connect the submit confirmation with a [Dialog](/uilib/components/dialog).
- `submitHandler` is a function that can be called to submit the form.
- `cancelHandler` is a function that can be called to cancel the form.
- `setConfirmationState` is a function that can be called to update the submit state.
- `confirmationState` is a string that can be used to determine the current state of the submit confirmation:
  - `idle`
  - `readyToBeSubmitted`
  - `submitInProgress`
  - `submissionComplete`
- `submitState` is the state of the `onSubmit` form event:
  - `error`
  - `info`
  - `warning`
  - `success`
  - `customStatus` Your custom status.
- `data` is the data that was submitted.

## Connect with a Dialog

You can connect the submit confirmation with a [Dialog](/uilib/components/dialog) by using the `connectWithDialog` property. This property is an object that contains the `openState`, `onConfirm`, `onDecline`, and `onClose` properties, which you can spread to the Dialog component.

```jsx
import { Dialog } from '@dnb/eufemia'
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

render(
  <Form.Handler>
    <Form.SubmitConfirmation
      renderWithState={({ connectWithDialog }) => {
        return (
          <Dialog
            variant="confirmation"
            title="Dialog confirmation title"
            description="Some content describing the situation."
            {...connectWithDialog}
          />
        )
      }}
    />
  </Form.Handler>,
)
```

## Using the submitHandler and cancelHandler

In addition to `connectWithDialog`, there are the `submitHandler` and `cancelHandler` functions, available to handle the submission and cancellation processes:

```jsx
<Form.SubmitConfirmation
  renderWithState={({ submitHandler, cancelHandler }) => {
    return (
      <>
        <Button onClick={submitHandler} text="Submit" />
        <Button onClick={cancelHandler} text="Cancel" />
      </>
    )
  }}
/>
```

## Accessibility

When the `cancelHandler` is called or the `onSubmit` event is completed, the [Form.SubmitButton](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/SubmitButton/) will regain focus.
