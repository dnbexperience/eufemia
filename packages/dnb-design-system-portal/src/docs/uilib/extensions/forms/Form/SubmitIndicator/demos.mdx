import * as Examples from './Examples'

## Demos

### Default appearance

<Examples.Default />

### SubmitIndicator in a simple form

Press the "Send" button to see the submit indicator.

<Examples.AsyncSubmitBehavior />

### SubmitIndicator with field validation

This example shows a combination of async validation and async change behavior, which could be used for e.g. **autosaving** the field value.

**NB:** if the indicator in the label does not have enough room, it will animate to a new line.

Make a change in the input field.

<Examples.AsyncChangeBehavior />

### Used in other components

<Examples.WithinOtherComponents />

### With a label

<Examples.WithinALabel />
