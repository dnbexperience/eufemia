## Description

`Form.SubmitIndicator` lets you show an indicator while async form operations are performed.

```jsx
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

render(<Form.SubmitIndicator state="pending" />)
```

### Integration

The indicator is implemented by default in the [Form.SubmitButton](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/SubmitButton/) and [FieldBlock](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/FieldBlock/) label. It will be displayed when the `onSubmit` event handler on the [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/) component is an async function. You can find some examples down below.
