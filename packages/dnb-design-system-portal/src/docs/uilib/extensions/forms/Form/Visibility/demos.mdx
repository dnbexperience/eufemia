## Demos

### Boolean example

<Examples.BooleanExample />

### Matching value

`visibleWhen` is pretty powerful. You can use it to show/hide based on the value of a `path`. You can also give it a `hasValue` function that gives you the current value, so you can assert it and return a boolean based on that.

```jsx
<Form.Visibility
  visibleWhen={{
    path: '/toggleValue',
    hasValue: (value) => value === 'checked',
  }}
>
  Content
</Form.Visibility>
```

<Examples.PathValue />

### Direct properties

<Examples.BasedOnBooleanTrue />

### Based on DataContext

<Examples.BasedOnContext />

### InferData

<Examples.InferData />

### Nested visibility example

Use `fieldPropsWhenHidden` and `keepInDOM` to keep the content in the DOM, even if it's not visible.

In this example we filter out all fields that have the `data-exclude-field` attribute. See the console output for the result.

<Examples.NestedExample />

### Filter data

**Note:** This example uses `filterData` with `pathDefined` on a Visibility component along, which is a declarative way to describe the data to be shown.

<Examples.FilterData />
