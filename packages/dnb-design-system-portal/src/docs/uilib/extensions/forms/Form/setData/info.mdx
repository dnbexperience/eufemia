## Description

With the `Form.setData` method, you can manage your form data outside of the form itself. This is beneficial when you need to utilize the form data in other places within your application:

```jsx
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

Form.setData('unique', { foo: 'bar' })

function Component() {
  return <Form.Handler id="unique">...</Form.Handler>
}
```

You link them together via the `id` (string, function, object or React Context as the reference) property.
