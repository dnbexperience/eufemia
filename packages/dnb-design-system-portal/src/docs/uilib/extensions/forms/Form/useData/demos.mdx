## Demos

### Set data outside of the form

<Examples.Default />

### Update the data outside of the form

The update function `update('/count', (count) => count + 1)` has TypeScript support and returns the correct type for `count` (number).

<Examples.Update />

### Shared state without a Form.Handler

<Examples.WithoutFormHandler />

### Get only data of visible fields

You can use the `reduceToVisibleFields` function to get only the data of visible (mounted) fields.

<Examples.VisibleData />

### Filter your data

This example uses the `keepInDOM` property to keep the field in the DOM.

But with the `filterData` method we can filter out all fields that have the `data-exclude-field` attribute.

In this demo, the `data-exclude-field` attribute is added when the field are hidden.

<Examples.FilterData />
