## Description

The `Form.useSnapshot` hook lets you store data snapshots of your form data, either inside or outside of the form context.

The hook returns an object with the following properties:

```tsx
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

function MyComponent() {
  const { createSnapshot, revertSnapshot } = Form.useSnapshot()

  return <>MyComponent</>
}

render(
  <Form.Handler>
    <MyComponent />
  </Form.Handler>,
)
```

- `createSnapshot` will store the current data as a new snapshot with the given id.
- `revertSnapshot` will revert the data to the snapshot with the given id (required). A reverted snapshot gets deleted from the memory.

## Usage

You can use the `Form.useSnapshot` hook with or without an `id` (string) property, which is optional and can be used to link the data to a specific [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/) component.

### Without an `id` property

Here "Component" is rendered inside the `Form.Handler` component and does not need an `id` property to access the form data:

```jsx
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <Form.Handler>
      <Component />
    </Form.Handler>
  )
}

function Component() {
  const { createSnapshot, revertSnapshot } = Form.useSnapshot()
}
```

### With an `id` property

While in this example, "Component" is outside the `Form.Handler` context, but linked together via the `id` (string) property:

```jsx
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <>
      <Form.Handler id="unique">...</Form.Handler>
      <Component />
    </>
  )
}

function Component() {
  const { createSnapshot, revertSnapshot } = Form.useSnapshot('unique')
}
```

This is beneficial when you need to utilize the form data in other places within your application.
