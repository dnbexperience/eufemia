## Description

`Value.Composition` combines two or more `Value.*` components into one.

By default, they will be placed in a horizontal layout. When rendered on a small screen, and the Composition contains Values with label they will be placed in a vertical layout.

Also good to know is that, there is an equivalent [Field.Composition](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/Composition/) component that can be used for [field](/uilib/extensions/forms/all-fields/) components.

```jsx
import { Value } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

render(
  <Value.Composition label="Label">
    <Value.String label="First" path="/first" />
    <Value.String label="Second" path="/second" />
  </Value.Composition>,
)
```

## Accessibility

When you combine multiple `Value.*` components together, consider enclosing them within the [SummaryList](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/SummaryList/) component. This component offers a standardized approach for presenting labels and values within an accessible definition list structure.
