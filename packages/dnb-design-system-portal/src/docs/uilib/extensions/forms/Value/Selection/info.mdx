import { Value } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Value.Selection />)
```

## Description

`Value.Selection` is a component for displaying a string value based on a user selection.

Before using this component, ensure there is not a more specific [value component](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/components/) available that better suits your needs.

There is a corresponding [Field.Selection](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/Selection) component.

```jsx
import { Value } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Value.Selection />)
```
