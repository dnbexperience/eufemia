## Description

`Wizard.NextButton` connects to `Wizard.Context` to move the user to the next step when clicked.

**Note:** This button is used in [Wizard.Buttons](/uilib/extensions/forms/Wizard/Buttons/), which is easier to integrate into most wizards.

```jsx
import { Form, Wizard } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

render(
  <Form.Handler>
    <Wizard.Container>
      <Wizard.Step title="Step 1">
        <Wizard.NextButton />
      </Wizard.Step>
      <Wizard.Step title="Step 2">next step</Wizard.Step>
    </Wizard.Container>
  </Form.Handler>,
)
```
