## Demos

See [WizardContainer demo section](/uilib/extensions/forms/Wizard/Container/demos) for more examples.

### Dynamic steps

<Examples.DynamicSteps />

### Inactive control

If you need more control over what steps the user can freely navigate to, the `inactive` prop allows you to treat a step as non-navigable even if it would be normally.

In this example, the first step is never clickable, and you can never skip ahead, even if the next steps have been visited.

<Examples.Inactive />
