## Description

`Wizard.Step` shows child components when the surrounding [Wizard.Container](/uilib/extensions/forms/Wizard/Container/) has been navigated to this step. Wizard.Container keeps track of what is the active step, and navigating between wizard steps is done through callbacks on the WizardContext, i.e. using [navigation buttons](/uilib/extensions/forms/Wizard/Buttons/).

```tsx
import { Form, Wizard } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

const Step1 = () => {
  return (
    <Wizard.Step title="Step 1">
      <Form.MainHeading>Heading</Form.MainHeading>
      <Card stack>
        <P>Contents</P>
      </Card>
      <Card stack>
        <P>Contents</P>
      </Card>

      <Wizard.Buttons />
    </Wizard.Step>
  )
}

const MyForm = () => {
  return (
    <Form.Handler>
      <Wizard.Container>
        <Step1 />
      </Wizard.Container>
    </Form.Handler>
  )
}
```

It uses [Flex.Stack](/uilib/layout/flex/stack/) so you don't need to wrap your content additionally.

## EditButton

In order to navigate back to another step, you can use the [EditButton](/uilib/extensions/forms/Wizard/Step/EditButton/) component.

## Events

If you need an event to be triggered when the user changes the active step, you can use the `onStepChange` in the [Wizard.Container](/uilib/extensions/forms/Wizard/Container/).
