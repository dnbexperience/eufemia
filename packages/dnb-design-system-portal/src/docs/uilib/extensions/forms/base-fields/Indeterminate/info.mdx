## Description

`Field.Indeterminate` component is used to display and handle the indeterminate state of a checkbox. It is an uncontrolled component, meaning that the state is managed automatically.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(
  <Field.Indeterminate
    dependencePaths={['/checkbox1', '/checkbox2', '/checkbox3']}
    path="/checkboxParent"
  />,
)
```

- [Docs code](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia/tree/main/packages/dnb-design-system-portal/src/docs/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/Indeterminate)

It should only be used in combination with checkbox looking variants.

Under the hood the [Field.Toggle](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/Toggle/) base field is used. That means you can use all the properties from the `Toggle` component.

## Details about the state handling

The indeterminate state of a parent checkbox should be shown when some children checkboxes are checked, but not all. In detail:

- When all children are checked, the parent should get checked.
  - When the parent gets checked (clicked), all children should get checked.
- When all children are unchecked, the parent should get unchecked.
  - When the parent gets unchecked (clicked), all children should get unchecked.
- When some children are checked, the parent should be set in an indeterminate state.
  - When the parent gets clicked, all children should get checked. This behavior can be changed to the opposite or `auto` by using the `propagateIndeterminateState` property. Auto means that the parent will switch from its current state to be inverted.
