## Description

`Field.Number` is the base component for receiving user input where the target data is of type `number`.

There is a corresponding [Value.Number](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/Value/Number) component.

## When to use and not to use

`Field.Number` only allows the user to enter numbers (negative and positive) and decimal numbers.

If a number has the type of number, and can not start with a zero, this field may be considered.

But for e.g. a customer number, you rather use [Field.String](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String/).

Internally, it is used by e.g. [Field.Currency](/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields/Currency/).

## Autocomplete and autofill

Check out the [Field.String](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String/#autocomplete-and-autofill) docs about autocomplete.
