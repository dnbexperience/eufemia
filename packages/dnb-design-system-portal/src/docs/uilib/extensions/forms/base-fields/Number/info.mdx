## Description

`Field.Number` is the base component for receiving user input where the target data is of type `number`.

There is a corresponding [Value.Number](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/Number) component.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.Number path="/myNumber" />)
```

## When to use and not to use

`Field.Number` only allows the user to enter numbers (negative and positive) and decimal numbers.

If a number has the type of number, and cannot start with a zero, this field may be considered.

But for e.g. a customer number, you rather use [Field.String](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String/).

Internally, it is used by e.g. [Field.Currency](/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields/Currency/).

## Browser autofill

Check out the [Field.String](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String/#autocomplete-and-autofill) docs about autocomplete.

## Step controls

When using `showStepControls`, the Number component provides buttons for decrementing and incrementing the input value, where the value of de/increment is determined by the `step` property.

It can also be used with [Field.Currency](/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields/Currency/).

### Accessibility

The component does not include focusable buttons, aligning with accessibility considerations for keyboard-only users, who can utilize arrow keys for navigation, like the `incrementable` [number input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number).

One of the reasons to make the buttons as not focusable is to avoid the keyboard-only users to tab through all the extra buttons during navigation.

Due to technical constraint, the `Field.Number` component will be announced as a `stepper` field – but will get the same instructions read out by a screen reader like VoiceOver, on how to change the value.
