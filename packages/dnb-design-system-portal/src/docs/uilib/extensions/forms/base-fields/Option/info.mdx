## Description

`Field.Option` is a pseudo-component that is used by parent components to configure options. It has no use on it's own. How it renders, and what extra props it accepts, are defined by the parent.

### Used in:

- [Field.ArraySelection](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/ArraySelection/)
- [Field.Selection](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/Selection/)

```tsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(
  <Field.Selection>
    <Field.Option value="foo" title="Foo!" />
    <Field.Option value="bar" title="Baar!" />
  </Field.Selection>,
)
```
