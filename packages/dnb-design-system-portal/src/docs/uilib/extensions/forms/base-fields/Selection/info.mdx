## Description

`Field.Selection` is a component for selecting between options using a dropdown or similar user experiences.

There is a corresponding [Value.Selection](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/Selection) component.

The [Field.Option](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/Option/) is a related component.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

render(
  <Field.Selection placeholder="Select something...">
    <Field.Option value="foo" title="Foo!" />
    <Field.Option value="bar" title="Baar!" />
  </Field.Selection>,
)
```

You can also use the `dataPath` property to provide the data to the component:

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

render(
  <Form.Handler
    data={{
      myDataPath: [
        { title: 'Foo!', value: 'foo' },
        { title: 'Bar!', value: 'bar' },
      ],
    }}
  >
    <Field.Selection dataPath="/myDataPath" />
  </Form.Handler>,
)
```

## About the Autocomplete variant

The autocomplete variant (`variant="autocomplete"`) is a special easy drop-in version â€“ basically as an replacement for the Dropdown variant, but with a search capability.

The [Autocomplete](/uilib/components/autocomplete/) by itself can be customized and used in various ways. If you need more control, you can use the `autocompleteProps` property to forward any additional properties (camelCase) to the [Autocomplete](/uilib/components/autocomplete/) component.
