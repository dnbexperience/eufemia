## About the Autocomplete variant

The autocomplete variant (`variant="autocomplete"`) is a special easy drop-in version â€“ basically as an replacement for the Dropdown variant, but with a search capability.

The [Autocomplete](/uilib/components/autocomplete/) by itself can be customized and used in various ways. If you need more control, you can use the `autocompleteProps` property to forward any additional props (camelCase) to the [Autocomplete](/uilib/components/autocomplete/) component.
