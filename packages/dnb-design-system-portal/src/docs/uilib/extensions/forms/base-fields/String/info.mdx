## Import

```tsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.String />)
```

## Description

`Field.String` is the base component for receiving user input where the target data is of type `string`.

There is a corresponding [Value.String](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/String) component.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.String path="/myValue" />)
```

## Browser autofill

The string component supports HTML `autocomplete` [attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete).

1. You may either set the property directly on each field:

```tsx
<Form.Handler>
  <Field.String autoComplete="first-name" path="/your-pointer" />
  <Field.String autoComplete="last-name" path="/your-pointer" />
</Form.Handler>
```

2. Or use the "less-code" approach by just giving the data pointer `path` a meaningful name:

```tsx
<Form.Handler autoComplete={true}>
  <Field.String path="/firstName" />
  <Field.String path="/lastName" />
</Form.Handler>
```

The `path` property will be used to set the `name` attribute.

## Accessibility

Avoid using the `maxlength` attribute when possible, as it is not accessible. Instead, use [TextCounter](/uilib/components/fragments/text-counter/) together with `Field.String`.

A demo of how to use the `TextCounter` with `Field.String` can be found [here](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String/#validation---maximum-length-with-textcounter).

This way, the user receives visual feedback on the number of characters entered and the maximum allowed, without being limited in their workflow.

You can still set the desired maximum number of characters by using the `maxLength` property in Eufemia Forms.
