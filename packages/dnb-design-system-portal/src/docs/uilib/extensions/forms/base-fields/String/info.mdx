## Description

`Field.String` is the base component for receiving user input where the target data is of type `string`.

There is a corresponding [Value.String](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/String) component.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.String path="/myValue" />)
```

## Browser autofill

The string component does support HTML `autocomplete` [attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete).

1. You may either set the property directly on each field:

```tsx
<Form.Handler>
  <Field.String autoComplete="first-name" path="/your-pointer" />
  <Field.String autoComplete="last-name" path="/your-pointer" />
</Form.Handler>
```

2. Or use the "less-code" approach, by just giving the data pointer `path` a meaningful name:

```tsx
<Form.Handler autoComplete={true}>
  <Field.String path="/firstName" />
  <Field.String path="/lastName" />
</Form.Handler>
```

The `path` property will be used to set the `name` attribute.

## Accessibility

Please avoid using the maxlength attribute whenever possible, as it is not accessible. Use [TextCounter](/uilib/components/fragments/text-counter/) together with `Field.String` instead.

A demo of how to use the `TextCounter` with `Field.String` can be found [here](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String/#validation---maximum-length-with-textcounter).

This way the user gets a visual feedback of the number of characters entered and the maximum number of characters allowed. And it will not limit the user in their workflow.

You still can still set the requirement of your desired maximum amount of characters by setting the `maxLength` property in Eufemia Forms.
