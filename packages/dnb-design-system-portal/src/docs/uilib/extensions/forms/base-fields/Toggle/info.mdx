## Import

```tsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.Toggle />)
```

## Description

`Field.Toggle` is a base component for allowing the user to toggle between two different values in the target data point.

Before using this component, ensure there is not a more specific [field component](/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields/) available that better suits your needs.

```tsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.Toggle path="/myState" />)
```
