## Description

Blocks are a collection of reusable fields and values. They can also be 100% customized and nested in each other. This makes it easy to reuse the same blocks in different contexts.

- A single block can be used without any further Eufemia Forms components, just like any other field and value.
- Each block should have integration tests.
- Each block has its own localization and translations.
- When you import a block, only the code and translations used in the block will be included in your production bundle.

Read about how to create a section (block) by using a [Form.Section](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Section/).

## Usage

You import a block like this:

```jsx
import { ChildrenWithAge } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms/blocks'
render(<ChildrenWithAge />)
```

### Integration

It is recommended to use blocks within a [Wizard](/uilib/extensions/forms/Wizard/) and [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/). However, they can also be used independently. In such cases, you can utilize the `onChange` event to listen for changes in the block.

You can also define a `path` to the block component. This makes it possible to reuse the same block component in different contexts.

```jsx
<ChildrenWithAge path="/account/holder/children" />
```

### Customization

The `overwriteProps` property lets you overwrite all of the field properties if needed:

```tsx
<ChildrenWithAge
  overwriteProps={{
    firstName: { label: 'Custom label' },
    lastName: { required: false, minLength: 0 },
  }}
/>
```

### Localization

You can change the texts and translations used inside of a block via the [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/):

```tsx
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/src/extensions/forms'
import { ChildrenWithAge } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms/blocks'

const myTranslations = {
  'nb-NO': { ChildrenWithAge: { hasChildren: { title: 'Egendefinert' } } },
  'en-GB': { ChildrenWithAge: { hasChildren: { title: 'Custom label' } } },
}

export function MyForm() {
  return (
    <Form.Handler translations={myTranslations}>
      <ChildrenWithAge />
    </Form.Handler>
  )
}
```
