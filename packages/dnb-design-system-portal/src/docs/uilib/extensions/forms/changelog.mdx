- Added `bubbleValidation` to [Form.Isolation](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Isolation/) and [Iterate.PushContainer](/uilib/extensions/forms/Iterate/PushContainer/), to prevent the form from being submitted when there are fields with errors.
- Added [createMinimumAgeValidator](/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields/NationalIdentityNumber/properties/#createminimumagevalidator) in [Field.NationalIdentityNumber](/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields/NationalIdentityNumber/) to make a customizable minimum age validator.
