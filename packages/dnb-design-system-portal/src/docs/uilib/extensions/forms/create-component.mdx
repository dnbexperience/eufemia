# Create your own component

Eufemia Forms contains of helper fields and tools so you can declaratively create interactive form components that flawlessly integrates between existing data and your custom form components.

```jsx
import {
  DataContext,
  Field,
  FieldBlock,
  FieldGroup,
  Value,
  ValueBlock,
  Visibility,
  useField,
  useValue,
} from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
```

Here is a first example on how to compose your own component:

<FirstExampleDemo />

## Hooks

### useField

The `useField` hook standardize handling of the value flow for a single field. It holds error state, hides it while the field is in focus, connects to surrounding `DataContext` (if present) and other things that all field components needs to do. By implementing custom field components and passing the received props (extending `FieldProps`) through `useField`, all these features work the same way as other field components, and you only need to implement the specific unique features of that field.

### useValue

The `useValue` hook standardize handling of the value flow for a single value. It connects to surrounding `DataContext` (if present) and other things that all value components needs to do. By implementing custom value components and passing the received props (extending `ValueProps`) through `useValue`, all these features work the same way as other value components, and you only need to implement the specific unique features of that component.
