# Create your own component

Eufemia Forms contains helper fields and tools so you can declaratively create interactive form components that flawlessly integrates between existing data and your custom form components.

By using the building blocks for field components, you save development time, and at the same time ensure that local, custom components work similarly, and fit into the setup with [the standardized field components](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/).

```jsx
import {
  FieldBlock,
  ValueBlock,
  useFieldProps,
} from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
```

<ListBasisAPIs />

## FieldBlock and useFieldProps

The `FieldBlock` component and the `useFieldProps` hook are the basis for all field components in Eufemia Forms.

`FieldBlock` provides a standardized way to display labels, error messages and other surrounding elements in a consistent manner.

While `useFieldProps` provides a standardized way to handle data flow, validation and error messages in a consistent manner.

<CreateBasicFieldComponent />

### More details

This example shows a custom component. The `useFieldProps` hook receives the props and adds extra properties to standardize field behavior. These includes `handleFocus`, `handleChange`, and `handleBlur` functions. Even if the field components has external callbacks like "onChange", these won't be altered. The "handle" variants simplifies your code.

### The example explained

Using these two form helpers in your field component triggers several automatic processes. These include timely validation checks, syncing value changes with the [DataContext](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/DataContext/), coordinating error messages across multiple fields, and preventing premature error displays while the user is editing the field.

Keep in mind, you can customize the behavior of [useFieldProps](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/useFieldProps) and other helper functions to make the component work exactly as you want.

### Your own validation

If you need custom validation that can't use the built-in JSON Schema or a derivative validator (like in the example above), you can create your own logic. Then, pass the result as an `error` prop to `FieldBlock`. All direct props override standard handling, giving you full control over your component.

### Customized even further

If you need something that looks even more different than the usual fields, you can drop `FieldBlock` and display surrounding elements in other ways â€“ but still get all the help of a data flow logic, such as `useFieldProps` offers.

Here follows an example that retrieves data from a surrounding DataContext, and creates a composite field based on other components from Eufemia:

<CreateComposedFieldComponent />

## Layout

When building your custom form components, preferably use the [Layout](/uilib/layout) component.

### Width definitions

These are the official sizes you can use when [creating your own form fields](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/).

```css
:root {
  --forms-field-width--small: 5rem;
  --forms-field-width--medium: 11rem;
  --forms-field-width--large: 21rem;
}
```

You can also use a [FieldBlock](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/FieldBlock/) and provide a `width` prop with a value of either `small`, `medium` or `large` and use it as a sized wrapper.
