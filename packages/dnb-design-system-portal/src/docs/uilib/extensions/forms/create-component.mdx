# Create your own component

Eufemia Forms contains of helper fields and tools so you can declaratively create interactive form components that flawlessly integrates between existing data and your custom form components.

```jsx
import {
  DataContext,
  Field,
  FieldBlock,
  FieldGroup,
  Value,
  ValueBlock,
  Visibility,
  useField,
  useValue,
} from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
```

Here is a first example on how to compose your own component:

<FirstExampleDemo />

## Components

## Hooks

### useDataValue

The `useDataValue` hook standardize handling of the value flow for a single consumer component representing one data point. It holds error state, hides it while the field is in focus, connects to surrounding `DataContext` (if present) and other things that all field or value components needs to do. By implementing custom field or value components and passing the received props through `useDataValue`, all these features work the same way as other field or value components, and you only need to implement the specific unique features of that component.
