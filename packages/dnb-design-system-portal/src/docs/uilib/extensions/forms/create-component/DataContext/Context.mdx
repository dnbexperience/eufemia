# DataContext.Context

## Description

The main context for [DataContext.Provider](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/DataContext/Provider) which the [Field](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/) and [Value](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/Value/) components connect to (optional) for sources and callbacks when it is present. It can be used for creating custom components in similar ways.
