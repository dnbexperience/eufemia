## Description

`FieldBlock` is a reusable wrapper for building [Field](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/Field) or [Value](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/Value) components.

It shows surrounding elements through properties from `FieldProps` like `label` and `error`, and ensure that spacing between different fields work as required when put into surrounding components like [FlexContainer](/uilib//components/layout/FlexContainer/) or [Card](/uilib//components/layout/Card/).

It can also be used to group multiple inner FieldBlock components, composing status (error) messages together as one component.

```jsx
import { FieldBlock } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

const YourFieldComponent = () => {
  return (
    <FieldBlock label="Legend" info="Info at the bottom">
      <Layout.FlexContainer>
        <FieldBlock label="Field A">...</FieldBlock>
        <FieldBlock label="Field B">...</FieldBlock>
      </Layout.FlexContainer>
    </FieldBlock>
  )
}
```
