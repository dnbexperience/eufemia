## Description

`FieldBlock` is a reusable wrapper [for building](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/) interactive [Field](/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields) components.

It shows surrounding elements through properties from `FieldProps` like `label` and `error`, and ensure that spacing between different fields work as required when put into surrounding components like [Flex.Container](/uilib/layout/flex/container/) or [Form.Card](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Card/).

It can also be used to group multiple inner FieldBlock components, composing status (error) messages together as one component. Check out the [Field.Composition](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/Composition/) docs for that.

```tsx
import { FieldBlock } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

const YourFieldComponent = () => {
  return (
    <FieldBlock
      forId="unique-id"
      label="A label"
      info="Info at the bottom"
    >
      <Input id="unique-id" />
    </FieldBlock>
  )
}
```

More information about the usage can be found in the [create your own component](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/) section.
