## Description

`FieldBlock` is a reusable wrapper for building [Field](/uilib/extensions/forms/fields) or [Value](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Value) components.

It shows surrounding elements through properties from `FieldProps` like `label` and `error`, and ensure that spacing between different fields work as required when put into surrounding components like [Flex.Container](/uilib/layout/flex/container/) or [Card](/uilib/components/card/).

It can also be used to group multiple inner FieldBlock components, composing status (error) messages together as one component.

```tsx
import { FieldBlock } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

const YourFieldComponent = () => {
  return (
    <FieldBlock label="Legend" info="Info at the bottom">
      <Flex.Container>
        <FieldBlock label="Field A">...</FieldBlock>
        <FieldBlock label="Field B">...</FieldBlock>
      </Flex.Container>
    </FieldBlock>
  )
}
```

## Composition fields

When you create a field that contains of several existing fields, it will be a so called "composition field".

You can use `composition={true}` to wrap the fields together horizontally:

```tsx
import { FieldBlock, Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

const YourFieldComponent = () => {
  return (
    <FieldBlock label="Legend" error="Error at the bottom" composition>
      <Field.String />
      <Field.String />
    </FieldBlock>
  )
}
```

Some working examples with actual `width` handling in the demos below.

When each field inside your composition is horizontally aligned for larger screens, they will wrap to a vertical layout for smaller screens.

If each of the fields have a label, the labels should ideally be top aligned. But when one of the labels contain more text than fits into one line, the fields will be bottom aligned.

In the demo section you find an [example](#composition-field-with-error) on how to handle form states.

## Messages

Messages that appears to be the same, will be grouped together and announced as one message.

You can also show an `error`, `warning` or `info` message at the same time.

## Accessibility

When using the `error`, `warning` or `info` property, the displayed [FormStatus](/uilib/components/form-status) components will be placed in the DOM before the content of the `FieldBlock` itself.

Additionally, the `FieldBlock` will also links together the related form elements by using `aria-describedby`, given the [useFieldProps](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/useFieldProps) is used in conjunction.

This will allow screen readers to find and announce the error message without too much frustration.
