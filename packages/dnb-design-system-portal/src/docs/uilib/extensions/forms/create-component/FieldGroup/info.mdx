import Demos from 'Docs/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/FieldGroup/demos'

## Description

With `FieldGroup` you can group several [Field-components](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/Field) and its error states to compose one single component.

It watches the states of its children and uses internally [Field.FieldBlock](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/FieldBlock) to display one state at a time.

```jsx
import { FieldGroup } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
```
