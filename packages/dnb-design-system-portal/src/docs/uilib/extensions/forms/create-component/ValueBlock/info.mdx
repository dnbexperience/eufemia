## Description

`FieldBlock` is a reusable wrapper for building [Value](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value) components.

```tsx
import { ValueBlock } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

const MyValueComponent = ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <ValueBlock {...rest}>{children}</ValueBlock>
)
```

For combining several value components into one, you can use [Value.Composition](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/Composition/).
