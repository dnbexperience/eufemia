### useDataValue

The `useDataValue` hook standardize handling of the value flow for a single consumer component representing one data point. It holds error state, hides it while the field is in focus, connects to surrounding `DataContext` (if present) and other things that all field or value components needs to do. By implementing custom field or value components and passing the received props through `useDataValue`, all these features work the same way as other field or value components, and you only need to implement the specific unique features of that component.

How to use:

```ts
const { value } = useDataValue(componentProps)
```

Advanced usage:

```ts
const {
  // Return Parameters:
  value,
  onChange,
  onFocus,
  onBlur,
  error,
  hasError,
  isChanged,
  setHasFocus,

  // Component Properties
  ...rest
} = useDataValue({
  // Your Component Properties:
  ...componentProps,

  // Internal Properties, listed down below:
  required,
  errorMessages,
})
```

#### Internal Properties

All properties are optional and can be used as needed. These properties can be provided as part of your component properties.

- `value` the input value (string).
- `emptyValue` defines what value is considered to be empty. Defaults to `undefined`. But an empty string is also validated when required is true.
- `path` the JSON pointer that defines the entry name/key in the data structure.

**Validation**

- `required` if true, it will call `validateRequired` for validation.
- `schema` or `pattern` for JSON schema validation powered by [ajv](https://ajv.js.org/).
- `validator` your custom validation function. It will run on every keystroke.
- `validateRequired` does allow you to provide a custom logic for how the `required` prop should validate.
- `onBlurValidator` your custom validation function. It will run on a `handleBlur()` call. Use it over `validator` for validations with side-effects.
- `validateInitially` in order to show an error without a change and blur event. Used for rare cases.
- `validateUnchanged` in order to validate without a change and blur event. Used for rare cases.
- `continuousValidation` in order to validate without a focus event beforehand. Used for rare cases.

**Error**

- `error` object like `FormError` that includes the string to display or an object with the key `validationRule`. More info down below.
- `errorMessages` object with your custom messages, where each key represents a `validationRule`. More info down below.

#### Return Parameters

It returns all of the given component properties, in addition to these:

- `value` the output value.
- `id` creates a memorized id.
- `dataContext` the internal shared data context.
- `error` the error object, in case an error is invoked. Will skip returning the error object, if the hook is used in a nested [FieldBlock](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/FieldBlock/).
- `hasError` will return true in case of an error, even if the hook is nested in a `FieldBlock`.
- `isChanged` returns `true` if the value has changed with e.g. `handleChange`.
- `setHasFocus` accepts a boolean as value. When called, it will update the internal logic - for event handling and validation. Will re-render the React Hook and its outer component.
- `onFocus` event handler to assign to a form element.
- `onBlur` event handler to assign to a form element.
- `onChange` event handler to assign to a form element.

#### Custom validateRequired

```ts
const validateRequired = (
  value: Value,
  { emptyValue, required, isChanged },
) => {
  return required && value === emptyValue
    ? new FormError('The value is required', {
        validationRule: 'required',
      })
    : undefined
}

const { error, hasError } = useDataValue({
  value: undefined,
  required: true,
  validateInitially: true,
  validateRequired,
  errorMessages: {
    required: 'Show this when "required" fails!',
  },
})
```

##### Validation order

During validation, the different APIs do have a prioritization order and will stop processing further when they match:

1. `required` prop
1. `schema` prop (including `pattern`)
1. `validator` prop

#### Error handling

Validation and error-handling is tight coupled together. When a validation fails, you may use the error-object to handle and show the failures/statuses.

To generate the error-object, `FormError` is used. You can use it as well:

```tsx
import { FormError } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(
  <Field.String
    label="Label"
    warning={new FormError("I'm a warning too...")}
  />,
)
```

But when you handle errors via `useDataValue`, you may rather provide an object with messages, which will be used to display the error:

```ts
const { error, hasError } = useDataValue({
  required: true,
  errorMessages: {
    required: 'Show this when "required" fails!',
  },
  ...componentProps,
})
```

In order to invoke an error without a change and blur event, you can use `validateInitially`:

```ts
const { error, hasError } = useDataValue({
  value: undefined,
  required: true,
  validateInitially: true,
  errorMessages: {
    required: 'Show this when "required" fails!',
  },
})
```

#### Event handlers

- `handleFocus()` to call the `onFocus` event.

- `handleBlur()` to call the `onBlur` event.

- `handleChange(value)` to call the `onChange` event. Will update/change the internal value and re-render the React Hook, so will the outer component too.

```ts
handleChange(value, (additionalArgs = null))
```

- `updateValue(value)` to update/change the internal value, without calling any events.

- `forceUpdate()` to re-render the React Hook along with the outer component.

#### Value transformers

The transformers are hooks to transform the value on different stages.

They should return a transformed value: `(value) => value`

- `toInput` transforms the value before it gets returned as the `value`:

- `fromInput` transforms the value given by `handleChange` before it is used in the further process flow. Use it to destruct the value form the original event object.

- `toEvent` transforms the internal value before it gets returned by even callbacks such as `onChange`, `onFocus` and `onBlur`. The second parameter returns the event type: `onChange`, `onFocus`, `onBlur` or `onBlurValidator`.

- `fromExternal` transforms the given props `value` before any other step gets entered.

- `transformValue` transforms the value given by `handleChange` after `fromInput` and before `updateValue` and `toEvent`. The second parameter returns the current value
