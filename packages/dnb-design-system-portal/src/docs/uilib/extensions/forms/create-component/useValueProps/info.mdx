# Description

The `useValueProps` hook standardize handling of the value flow for a single consumer component representing one data point.

It also provides a way to transform the value.

This hook works perfectly together with [ValueBlock](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/ValueBlock/).

## How to use

```tsx
import { useValueProps } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

const MyValueComponent = (props) => {
  const { value, ...rest } = useValueProps(props)
  return <ValueBlock {...rest}>{value}</ValueBlock>
}

render(<MyValueComponent path="/dataSelector" />)
```

### Internal Properties

All properties are optional and can be used as needed. These properties can be provided as part of your component properties.

- `value` the input value (string).
- `emptyValue` defines what value is considered to be empty. Defaults to `undefined`. But an empty string will also be validated when required is true.
- `path` the JSON pointer that defines the entry name/key in the data structure.
- `itemPath` similar to `path`, but is used when run inside the [Iterate](/uilib/extensions/forms/Iterate/) context.

### Return Parameters

It returns all of the given component properties, in addition to these:

- `value` the output value.

### Value transformers

The transformers are hooks to transform the value on different stages.

They should return a transformed value: `(value) => value`

- `toInput` transforms the value before it is returned. This applies whether the original source of the value is the value prop or the data context.

- `fromExternal` transforms the provided `value` prop before any other operations are performed.

In addition there are **value transformers** which should be used outside of the value component (by the value consumer):

- `transformIn` transforms the `value` before its displayed in the value component.
