## Demos

### Base field components

Base field components are targeting the data type they produce. They can
receive values and change handlers directly by props.

<Examples.BaseFieldComponents />

### Feature fields

Feature fields build on top of base field components and provide standard
props for simplified form implementations.

<Examples.FeatureFields />

### Layout components

Wrapping inputs in layout components provide the standard design without
the need for local styles.

<Examples.LayoutComponents />

### Using DataContextProvider

Wrapping fields with a DataContextProvider component lets them read and
write data to one common data set, and have input and output of data in
one place instead of connecting to every single field component.
