# Extended features

Forms is a flexible set of building blocks for form functionality. Besides field components and data display, it consists of more complex functionality for surrounding processes such as data flow, validation and building UI.

## [Form](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form)

Form provides the main forms-helpers including data provider and event handling. This makes it possible to do a combined processing of the data for a form, so you don't have to create individual distribution of data and callbacks to persist changes for each field individually.

Example using the [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/Handler) collecting data with `onSubmit`:

```jsx
import { Form, Field, Value } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
const existingData={
  email: 'name@email.no'
  date: '2024-01-01'
}
function Component() {
  const { data } = Form.useData('unique')

  return (
    <Form.Handler id="unique" data={existingData} onSubmit={submitHandler}>
      <Field.Email path="/email" />
      <Value.Date path="/date" />
      <Form.SubmitButton />
    </Form.Handler>
  )
}
```

### Schema validation

Eufemia Forms does support [Ajv schema validator](https://ajv.js.org/) on both single fields and the whole data set â€“ if needed.

[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) is a flexible standard that makes it possible to describe the data's structure and validation needs, both for the individual value, and more complex rules across the data set.

Descriptions and examples of such validation can be found [on a separate page](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/schema-validation).

You can also [create your own Ajv instance](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/schema-validation/#custom-ajv-instance-and-keywords) and pass it to your form.

This is useful if you want to use a custom schema keyword and `validate` function or if you want to use a different version of Ajv.

## [Data context](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/DataContext/)

`DataContext` builds a surrounding [React context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) that binds an entire source dataset together with the fields placed within. It enables fields and other components to retrieve data from the source data using `path` parameters that identify where in the source data the target value is located, and the same components will report changes to the data back so the context can update the dataset.

## [Steps layout](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/StepsLayout)

StepsLayout is a wrapper component for showing forms with a StepIndicator for navigation between several steps. It also includes components for navigating between steps.

Example using the [StepsLayout](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/StepsLayout) for handling stepped layouts:

```jsx
import { StepsLayout } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(
  <StepsLayout>
    <StepsLayout.Step title="Name">
      <Form.MainHeading>Profile</Form.MainHeading>
    </StepsLayout.Step>
  </StepsLayout>,
)
```

## [Value](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Value/)

Value components are in practice like a field component whose value cannot be changed. They can be displayed with or without a label, and they format the value based on given rules. They can also connect to the surrounding [DataContext](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/DataContext/).

## [Iterate](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Iterate/)

`Iterate` is components and functionality for traversing values and parts of data sets such as arrays, which contain a varying number of elements where the number of components on the screen depends on how many elements the data consists of.
