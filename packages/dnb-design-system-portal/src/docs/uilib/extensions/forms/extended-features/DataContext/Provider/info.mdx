## Description

`DataContext.Provider` is the context provider that has to wrap the features if components of Field and Value is to be used with a common source instead of distributing values and events individually.

For a more complete feature set tailored to building forms, please use [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/Handler). It uses DataContext internally.
