## Demos

### In combination with a SubmitButton

This example uses an async `onSubmit` event handler. It will disable all fields and show an indicator on the [SubmitButton](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/SubmitButton/) while the form is pending.

With an async function, you can also handle the response from the server and update the form with the new data.

```ts
// Async function
const onSubmit = async (data) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    })
    const data = await response.json()
    Form.setData('unique', data) // Whatever you want to do with the data
  } catch (error) {
    return error // Will display the error message in the form
  }
}
```

### New location after async submit

<Examples.AsyncSubmitComplete />

### Async validation with async onChange

Type "valid" in order to see the validation message.

<Examples.AsyncChangeAndValidation />

### Filter your data

By using the `filterData` prop you can filter out data that you don't want to send to your server.

It will filter out data from the `onSubmit` event property.

In this example we filter out all fields that are disabled.

The [useData](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/useData/) hook also returns a `filterData` function you can use to filter data the same way.

<Examples.FilterData />

### With session storage

Changes you make to the fields are temporarily saved and loaded
when the browser reloads. The data is stored until the session storage is invalidated.

<Examples.SessionStorage />

### Autocomplete (autofill) user data

<Examples.Autofill />
