## Demos

### In combination with a SubmitButton

<Examples.Default />

### Filter your data

By using the `filterData` prop you can filter out data that you don't want to send to your server.

It will filter out data from the `onSubmit` event property.

In this example we filter out all fields that are disabled.

The [useData](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/useData/) hook also returns a `filterData` function you can use to filter data the same way.

<Examples.FilterData />

### With session storage

Changes you make to the fields are temporarily saved and loaded
when the browser reloads. The data is stored until the session storage is invalidated.

<Examples.SessionStorage />

### Autocomplete (autofill) user data

<Examples.Autofill />
