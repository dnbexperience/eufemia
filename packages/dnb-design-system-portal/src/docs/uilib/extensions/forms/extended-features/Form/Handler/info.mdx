## Description

The `Form.Handler` component provides both the [Form.Element](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/Element) and a HTML form element.

- It ensures, users can press **enter key** while focusing on an input field.
- It calls `preventDefault` by default.

```jsx
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(
  <Form.Handler
    data={existingData}
    onChange={...}
    onSubmit={...}
  >
    Your Form
  </Form.Handler>,
)
```

## Browser autofill

You can set `autoComplete` on the `Form.Handler` â€“ each [Field.String](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String/)-field will then get `autoComplete="on"`:

```tsx
<Form.Handler autoComplete={true}>
  <Field.String path="/firstName" />
  <Field.String path="/lastName" />
</Form.Handler>
```

The `path` property will be used to set the `name` attribute, which lets browser know which autocomplete value should be proposed to the user.

## Temporary storage

The `sessionStorageId` feature uses the browsers session-storage (temporary storage mechanism) to store data entered by the user.

This lets the user navigate away and come back to the form, without loosing already entered data.

Ensure you only use this feature for non-sensitive data.

It will flush the storage once the form gets submitted.
