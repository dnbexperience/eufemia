### With SubmitIndicator

Example of showing the [SubmitIndicator](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/SubmitIndicator/) with the property `showSubmitIndicator` set to `true`.

When using the submit button inside [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/Handler/) you can use an async `onSubmit` event handler to show a loading indicator when the form is submitting.
