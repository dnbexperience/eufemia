## Description

`Form.SubmitIndicator` lets you show an indicator while async form operations are performed.

**BETA:** The design is not 100% finalised and may change to be officially approved by UX through an RFC.

```jsx
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

render(<Form.SubmitIndicator state="pending" />)
```

### Integration

The indicator is implemented by default in the [SubmitButton](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/SubmitButton/) and [FieldBlock](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/FieldBlock/) label. It will be displayed when the `onSubmit` event is triggered or when `enableAsyncBehavior` is set to true on the [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/Handler/) component. You find some examples down below.
