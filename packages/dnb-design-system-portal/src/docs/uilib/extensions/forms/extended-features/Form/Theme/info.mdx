## Description

`Form.Theme` is a provider for theming form fields.

For now, it only provides theming of sizes of input fields, including Autocomplete and Dropdown. See example below.

You can nest `Form.Theme` to provide different themes for different parts of the form.

**BETA:** The sizes are not 100% finalised and may change to be officially approved by UX through an RFC.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(
  <Form.Theme size="medium">
    <Form.Input />
    <Form.Theme size="large">
      <Form.Input />
    </Form.Theme>
  </Form.Theme>,
)
```
