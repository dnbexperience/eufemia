## Description

JSON Schema is a vocabulary for annotating and validating data in js. More about JSON Schema on [json-schema.org](https://json-schema.org/)

A schema can be used from the simplest description of the data type of a value:

```js
{
  type: 'string'
}
```

Results in:

```json
"Foo"
```

To an object with both rules for required fields and validation rules for single values:

```js
{
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    textField: { type: 'string', minLength: 5 },
    numberField: { type: 'number', maximum: 100 },
  },
  required: ['textField']
}
```

Results in:

```json
{
  "textField": "abcde",
  "numberField": 123
}
```

### Using schema with DataContext

Since a [DataContext](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/DataContext/) (used in isolation or through the use of [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/Handler/)) supports JSON Schema, these two examples will result in the same validation for the user:

```jsx
<Form.Handler data={user}>
  <Field.String path="/name" label="Name" minLength={3} required />
  <Field.Email path="/email" label="E-mail" required />
  <Field.Number
    path="/birthyear"
    label="Birth year"
    minimum={1900}
    maximum={2023}
    required
  />
</Form.Handler>
```

vs.

```tsx
const schema = {
  properties: {
    name: { minLength: 3 },
    email: { type: 'string' },
    birthyear: { minimum: 1900, maximum: 2023 },
  },
  required: ['name', 'email', 'birthyear'],
}
<Form.Handler data={user} schema={schema}>
  <Field.String path="/name" label="Name" />
  <Field.Email path="/email" label="E-mail" />
  <Field.Number path="/birthyear" label="Birth year" />
</Form.Handler>
```

This makes it possible to create a uniform, testable description and requirements specification for the data, which can be tested independently of frontend code, and used across systems, e.g. frontend and backend.

Also, note you can describe the schema without using the `type` property, as the type is inferred from schema type. More on that topic in the [Ajv docs](https://ajv.js.org/guide/typescript.html#utility-types-for-schemas).

### Complex schemas

In addition to basic validation as in the example above, JSON Schema can be used for more complex. Examples of definitions supported by the standard are:

- Requirement that the object must not have other properties than those defined in `properties`.
- Nested data structures and combinations of objects and arrays with rules for array elements (fixed or repetitive elements).
- Regular expressions for the syntax of individual values.
- Enum (a set of valid values).
- Rules for the number of elements in arrays.
- Rules for the number of properties in objects.
- Predefined format rules (eg 'uri', 'email' and 'hostname').
- Logical operators such as 'not', 'oneOf', 'allOf' and 'anyOf' which can be filled with rules for all or part of the data set.
- Rule set based on the content of values (if-then-else).
- Rules (sub-schemas) that become applicable if a given value is present.
- Reuse within the definition, such as one and the same object structure being used as a definition for several locations in a structure.
