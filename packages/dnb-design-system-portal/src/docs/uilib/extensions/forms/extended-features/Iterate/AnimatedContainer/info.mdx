## Description

`Iterate.AnimatedContainer` can be used to animate items when they are added or removed. It provides a smooth transition effect for a better user experience.

```tsx
import { Iterate } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

render(
  <Iterate.Array>
    <Iterate.AnimatedContainer>Item Content</Iterate.AnimatedContainer>
  </Iterate.Array>,
)
```

## Accessibility

The `Iterate.AnimatedContainer` component has an `aria-label` attribute, which is set to the `title` prop value. It uses a section element to wrap the content, which helps users with screen readers to get the needed announcement.
