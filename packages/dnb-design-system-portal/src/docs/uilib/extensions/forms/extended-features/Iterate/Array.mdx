title: 'Array'
description: '`Iterate.Array` works in many ways similar to field-components. It has a value-prop that can receive an array or you can give it a path if you want it to retrieve an array from a surrounding DataContext. All children components of Iterate.Array are rendered once per element the array-value consists of.'
