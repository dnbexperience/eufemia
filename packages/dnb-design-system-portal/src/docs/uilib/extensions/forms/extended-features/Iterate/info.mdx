## Description

Iterate is components and functionality for traversing values and parts of data sets such as arrays, which contain a varying number of elements where the number of components on the screen depends on how many elements the data consists of.

```tsx
import { Iterate, Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(
  <Iterate.Array
    label="Array label"
    value={['Iron Man', 'Captain America', 'The Hulk']}
  >
    <Field.String itemPath="/" />
  </Iterate.Array>,
)
```
