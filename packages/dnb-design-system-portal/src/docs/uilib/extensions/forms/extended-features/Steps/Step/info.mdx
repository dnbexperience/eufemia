## Description

`Steps.Step` shows child components when the surrounding [Steps.Layout](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Steps/Layout/) has been navigated to this step. Steps.Layout keeps track of what is the active step, and navigating between steps is done through callbacks on the StepsContext, i.e. using [navigation buttons](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Steps/Buttons/).

```jsx
import { Form, Steps } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

const Step1 = () => {
  return (
    <Steps.Step title="Step 1">
      <Form.MainHeading>Heading</Form.MainHeading>
      <Card stack>
        <P>Contents</P>
      </Card>
      <Card stack>
        <P>Contents</P>
      </Card>
      <Steps.Buttons />
    </Steps.Step>
  )
}

const MyForm = () => {
  return (
    <Form.Handler>
      <Steps.Layout>
        <Step1 />
      </Steps.Layout>
    </Form.Handler>
  )
}
```
