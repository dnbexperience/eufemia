## Description

`Value.SummaryList` uses definition lists to semantically make content consumable for screen readers.

**BETA:** The design is not 100% finalised and may change to be officially approved by UX through an RFC.

```jsx
import { Value } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(
  <Value.SummaryList layout="grid">
    <Value.String label="Label" path="/myValue" />
  </Value.SummaryList>,
)
```
