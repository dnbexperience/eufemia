# Wizard layouts

`Wizard` is a set of components for showing forms with a [StepIndicator](/uilib/components/step-indicator/) for navigation between several wizard. It also includes components for navigating between wizard.

```jsx
import { Wizard } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
```

<ListWizardComponents />

## Summary step

A Wizard needs a summary step at the end. You can use the `Wizard.Step` component for that, including the [Value.SummaryList](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Value/SummaryList/) component:

```tsx
import { Form, Wizard, Value } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

const MyForm = () => {
  return (
    <Form.Handler>
      <Wizard.Container>
        <Wizard.Step title="Step 1">...</Wizard.Step>
        <Wizard.Step title="Step 2">...</Wizard.Step>
        <Wizard.Step title="Summary">
          <Value.SummaryList layout="grid">
            <Value.String label="Label" path="/myValue" />
          </Value.SummaryList>
        </Wizard.Step>
      </Wizard.Container>
    </Form.Handler>
  )
}
```
