## Description

`Field.Address` is a wrapper component for the [input of strings](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String), with user experience tailored for street addresses.

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.Address />)
```

There is a corresponding [Value.Address](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/Address) component.

## Characteristics

- If the user enters an address with a space, the space is removed.
- `autocomplete` is by default set to `street-address`, but can be customized to using a grouping identifier like so `billing street-address`, see [mdn docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete#grouping_identifier).
- `inputmode` is by default set to `text`.
