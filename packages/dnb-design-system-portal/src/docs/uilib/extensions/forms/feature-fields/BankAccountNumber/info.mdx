## Description

`Field.BankAccountNumber` is a wrapper component for the [input of strings](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String), with user experience tailored for bank account values.

This field is meant for Norwegian bank account numbers, and therefor takes a 11-digit string as a value. A Norwegian bank account number can have a leading zero, which is why this value is a string and not a number.
More info can be found at [Wikipedia](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kontonummer)

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.BankAccountNumber />)
```

There is a corresponding [Value.BankAccountNumber](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/BankAccountNumber) component.
