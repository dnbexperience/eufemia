## Description

`Field.Currency` is a wrapper component for the [input of numbers](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/Number), with user experience tailored for currency values.

It supports the HTML [autocomplete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) attribute. Consider setting `autoComplete="transaction-amount"` if used to set the amount of a transaction, in a payment form.

There is a corresponding [Value.Currency](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/Currency) component.

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.Currency />)
```
