## Description

`Field.Date` is a wrapper component for the [DatePicker](/uilib/components/date-picker/), with user experience tailored for date values.

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.Date />)
```

There is a corresponding [Value.Date](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/Date) component.

## Validators

### Internal validators exposed

`Field.Date` exposes the `dateValidator` validator through its `onBlurValidator` property, take a look at [this demo](/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields/Date/demos/#extend-validation-with-custom-validation-function).
The `dateValidator` validator, validates invalid dates, and dates against the `minDate` and `maxDate` properties.
