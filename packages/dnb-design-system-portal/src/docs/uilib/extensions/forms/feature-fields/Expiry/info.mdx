## Description

`Field.Expiry` is a wrapper component for the [input of strings](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String), with user experience tailored for expiry dates for payment cards.

It supports the HTML [autocomplete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) attribute, and by default set it to `cc-exp-month` for the month field, and to `cc-exp-year` for the year field.

## Validators

### Internal validators exposed

`Field.Expiry` exposes the `expiryValidator` validator through its `onBlurValidator` property, take a look at [this demo](/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields/Expiry/demos/#extend-validation-with-custom-validation-function).
The `expiryValidator` validator, validates invalid month and/or year.
