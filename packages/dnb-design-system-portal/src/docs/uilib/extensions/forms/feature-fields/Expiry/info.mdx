## Description

`Field.Expiry` is a wrapper component for the [input of strings](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String), with user experience tailored for expiry dates for payment cards.

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.Expiry />)
```

It supports the HTML [autofill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) attribute (`cc-exp-month` and `cc-exp-year`) if no value is given.
