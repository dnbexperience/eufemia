## Description

`Field.Name` is a wrapper component for the [input of strings](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String), with user experience tailored for first and last name and company names.

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <Field.SummaryList>
      <Field.Name />
      <Field.Name.First value="Nora" />
      <Field.Name.Last value="MÃ¸rk" />
      <Field.Name.Company value="DNB" />
    </Field.SummaryList>
  )
}
```

There is a corresponding [Value.Name](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/Name) component.

## Characteristics

- Only valid characters are allowed for first and last name (except company name).
- Trailing spaces are removed.
- The HTML `autocomplete` attribute is set to:
  - `name` by default.
  - `given-name` and `family-name` for first and last name.
  - `organization-name` for company name.
