## Description

`Field.NationalIdentityNumber` is a wrapper component for the [input of strings](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String), with user experience tailored for national identity number values.

This field is meant for norwegian national identity numbers, and therefor takes a 11-digit string as a value. A norwegian national identity number can have a leading zero, hence why its a string and not a number.
More info can be found at [Skatteetaten](https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/national-registry/identitetsnummer/fodselsnummer/#:~:text=A%20national%20identity%20number%20consists,national%20identity%20number%20are%20220676)

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.NationalIdentityNumber />)
```

There is a corresponding [Value.NationalIdentityNumber](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/NationalIdentityNumber) component.
