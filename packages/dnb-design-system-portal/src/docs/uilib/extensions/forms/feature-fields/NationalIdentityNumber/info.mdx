## Description

`Field.NationalIdentityNumber` is a wrapper component for the input of strings, with user experience tailored for national identity number values.

This field is meant for norwegian national idntity numbers, and therefor takes a 11-digit string as a value. A national identity number can start with a leading zero, which is not a valid number, hence why its a string and not a number.

```
