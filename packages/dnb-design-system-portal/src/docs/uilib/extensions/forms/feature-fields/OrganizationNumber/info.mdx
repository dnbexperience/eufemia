## Description

`Field.OrganizationNumber` is a wrapper component for the [input of strings](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String), with user experience tailored for organization number values.

This input expects a 9-digit number as its value. This is because Norwegian organization numbers are 9-digits long, based on info from [Brønnøysundregisteret](https://www.brreg.no/en/about-us-2/our-registers/about-the-central-coordinating-register-for-legal-entities-ccr/about-the-organisation-number/?nocache=1701776533136)
It validates input for Norwegian organization numbers, as described by [Brønnøysundregistrene](https://www.brreg.no/om-oss/registrene-vare/om-enhetsregisteret/organisasjonsnummeret/).
The validation happens on blur, internally using the `onBlurValidator` [property](/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields/OrganizationNumber/properties/#field-specific-properties).

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.OrganizationNumber />)
```

There is a corresponding [Value.OrganizationNumber](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/OrganizationNumber) component.

## Validators

### Internal validators exposed

`Field.OrganizationNumber` expose the `organizationNumberValidator` validator through its `onChangeValidator` and `onBlurValidator` property, take a look at [this demo](/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields/OrganizationNumber/demos/#extend-validation-with-custom-validation-function).
The `organizationNumberValidator` validator, validates if the organization number provided is a [Norwegian organization number](https://www.brreg.no/om-oss/registrene-vare/om-enhetsregisteret/organisasjonsnummeret/) or not.
