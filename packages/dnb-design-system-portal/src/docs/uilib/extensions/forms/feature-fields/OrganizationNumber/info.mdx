## Description

`Field.OrganizationNumber` is a wrapper component for the [input of strings](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String), with user experience tailored for organization number values.

This input expects a 9-digit number as its value. This is because Norwegian organization numbers are 9-digits long, based on info from [Brønnøysundregisteret](https://www.brreg.no/en/about-us-2/our-registers/about-the-central-coordinating-register-for-legal-entities-ccr/about-the-organisation-number/?nocache=1701776533136)
It validates input for norwegian organization numbers, as described by [Brønnøysundregistrene](https://www.brreg.no/om-oss/registrene-vare/om-enhetsregisteret/organisasjonsnummeret/).

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.OrganizationNumber />)
```

There is a corresponding [Value.OrganizationNumber](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/OrganizationNumber) component.
