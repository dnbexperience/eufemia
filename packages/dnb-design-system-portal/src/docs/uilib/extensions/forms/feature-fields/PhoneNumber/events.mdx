## Events

<DataValueWriteEvents />

### Argument value

The argument value returned by the event handlers is a string where the country code and phonenumber is seperated by a space, e.g. `+47 9123457`. If the `omitCountryCodeField` is set to `true`, then only the phonenumber will be used, so the argument would be `9123457` without the leading country code.
