## Description

`Field.PhoneNumber` is a wrapper component for the input of strings, with user experience tailored for phone number values.

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.PhoneNumber />)
```

There is a corresponding [Value.PhoneNumber](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/Value/PhoneNumber) component.

## Value

This component behaves as "one single component". Therefor it combines the country code and the number to a single string during an event callback.

Also, the `value` property should be a string with the country code, separated from the main number by a space.

The component returns the `emptyValue` when no number is set, which defaults to `undefined`.

### Default country code

The default country code is set to `+47`.
