## Description

`Field.PostalCodeAndCity` is a wrapper component for input of two separate values with user experience tailored for postal code and city values.

These fields is meant for Norwegian postal codes and cities. The postal code input takes a 4-digit string as values, since its meant for norwegian postal codes. A norwegian postal code can have a leading zero, which is why the value is a string and not a number.
More info about postal codes can be found at [posten](https://www.bring.no/tjenester/adressetjenester/postnummer).

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.PostalCodeAndCity />)
