## Description

`Field.PostalCodeAndCity` is a wrapper component for input of two separate [input of strings](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String) with user experience tailored for postcode and city values.

These fields is meant for Norwegian postcodes and cities. The postcode input takes a 4-digit string as values, since its meant for Norwegian postcodes. A Norwegian postcode can have a leading zero, which is why the value is a string and not a number.
More info about postcodes can be found at [Posten](https://www.bring.no/tjenester/adressetjenester/postnummer).

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.PostalCodeAndCity />)
```

There is a corresponding [Value.PostalCodeAndCity](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/PostalCodeAndCity) component.
