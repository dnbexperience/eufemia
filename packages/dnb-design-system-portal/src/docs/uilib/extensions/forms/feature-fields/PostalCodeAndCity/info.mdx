## Description

`Field.PostalCodeAndCity` is a wrapper component for input of two separate [input of strings](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String) with user experience tailored for postal code and city values.

These fields is meant for Norwegian postal codes and cities. The postal code input takes a 4-digit string as values, since it's meant for Norwegian postal codes. A Norwegian postal code can have a leading zero, which is why the value is a string and not a number.
More info about postal codes can be found at [Posten](https://www.bring.no/tjenester/adressetjenester/postnummer).

It supports the HTML [autocomplete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) attribute, and by default set it to `postal-code` for the postal code field, and to `address-level2` for the city field.

There is a corresponding [Value.PostalCodeAndCity](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/PostalCodeAndCity) component.

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.PostalCodeAndCity />)
```
