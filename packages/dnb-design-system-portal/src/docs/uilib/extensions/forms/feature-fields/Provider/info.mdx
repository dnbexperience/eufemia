## Description

`Field.Provider` is a provider for forwarding fields properties, such as `required` or `disabled` to all nested field components.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Form, Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(
  <Field.Provider required disabled>
    <Field.String />
  </Field.Provider>,
)
```

Keep in mind, you can also set `required` or `disabled` on the [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/). And invert the logic via the `Field.Provider` by using `required={false}` or `disabled={false}`.
