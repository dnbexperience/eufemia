## Description

`Field.SelectCountry` is a wrapper component for [Field.Selection](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/Selection), with options built in for selecting a country.
[The list of available countries to select](/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields/SelectCountry/properties/#list-of-available-countries) is carefully curated to meet the demands we know today.
When selecting a country, the value returned is the selected country's [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) (country code) like `NO` for Norway.

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.SelectCountry />)
```

It supports the HTML [autocomplete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) attribute (`country-name`) if no value is given.

There is a corresponding [Value.SelectCountry](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/SelectCountry) component.

## Support for locales like `sv-SE` and `da-DK`

In addition to the default support for `nb-NO` and `en-GB`, you can also use the `sv-SE` and `da-DK` locales to display country names in Swedish or Danish.

Learn more about [importing additional locales](/uilib/usage/customisation/localization/#eufemia-forms).

### Filter or prioritize country listing

You can filter countries with the `countries` property's values `Scandinavia`, `Nordic` or `Europe`.

Countries are sorted in alphabetically order, with the following prioritized countries on top of the list:

- Norway
- Sweden
- Denmark
- Finland

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.PhoneNumber countries="Prioritized" />)
```

### TransformIn and TransformOut

You can use the `transformIn` and `transformOut` to transform the value before it gets displayed in the field and before it gets sent to the form context. The second parameter is the country object. You may have a look at the demo below to see how it works.

```tsx
import type { CountryType } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms/Field/SelectCountry'

// From the Field (internal value) to the data context or event parameter
const transformOut = (internal: string, country: CountryType) => {
  if (internal) {
    return `${country.name} (${internal})`
  }
}

// To the Field (from e.g. defaultValue)
const transformIn = (external: unknown) => {
  return String(external).match(/\((.*)\)/)?.[1] || 'NO'
}
```

### onFocus, onBlur, onChange

These events have an additional parameter with the country object.

```tsx
const onFocus = (value, country) => {}
```

### The country object

```ts
{
  cdc: '47',
  iso: 'NO',
  name: 'Norge',
  i18n: { en: 'Norway', nb: 'Norge' },
  regions: ['Scandinavia', 'Nordic'],
  continent: 'Europe',
}
```
