## Description

`Field.SelectCountry` is a wrapper component for [Field.Selection](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/Selection), with options built in for selecting a country.
[The list of available countries to select](/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields/SelectCountry/properties/#list-of-available-countries) is carefully curated to meet the demands we know today.
When selecting a country, the value returned is the selected country's [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) (country code) like `NO` for Norway.

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.SelectCountry />)
```

It supports the HTML [autocomplete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) attribute (`country-name`) if no value is given.

There is a corresponding [Value.SelectCountry](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/SelectCountry) component.

### Filter or prioritize country listing

You can filter countries with the `countries` property's values `Scandinavia`, `Nordic` or `Europe`.

Countries are sorted in alphabetically order, with the following prioritized countries on top of the list:

- Norway
- Sweden
- Denmark
- Finland

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.PhoneNumber countries="Prioritized" />)
```
