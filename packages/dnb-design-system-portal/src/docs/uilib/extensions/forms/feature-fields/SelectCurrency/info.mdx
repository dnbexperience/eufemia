## Description

`Field.SelectCurrency` is a wrapper component for [Field.Selection](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/Selection), with options built in for selecting a currency.
[The list of available currencies to select](/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields/SelectCurrency/properties/#list-of-available-currencies) is carefully curated to meet the demands we know today.
When selecting a currency, the value returned is the selected currency's [ISO 4217 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) (currency code) like `NOK` for Norwegian krone.

It supports the HTML [autocomplete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) attribute. Consider setting `autoComplete="transaction-currency"` if used to set the currency of a transaction, in a payment form.

There is a corresponding [Value.SelectCurrency](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/SelectCurrency) component.

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.SelectCurrency />)
```

### Filter or prioritize currency listing

You can filter currencies with the `currencies` property's values `Scandinavia`, `Nordic` or `Europe`.

Currencies are sorted in alphabetically order, with the following prioritized currencies on top of the list:

- Norwegian krone
- Swedish krona
- Danish krone
- Euro
- United States dollar

### TransformIn and TransformOut

You can use the `transformIn` and `transformOut` to transform the value before it gets displayed in the field and before it gets sent to the form context. The second parameter is the currency object. You may have a look at the demo below to see how it works.

```tsx
import type { CurrencyType } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms/Field/SelectCurrency'

// From the Field (internal value) to the data context or event parameter
const transformOut = (internal: string, currency: CurrencyType) => {
  if (internal) {
    return `${currency.name} (${internal})`
  }
}

// To the Field (from e.g. defaultValue)
const transformIn = (external: unknown) => {
  return String(external).match(/\((.*)\)/)?.[1] || 'NOK'
}
```

### onFocus, onBlur, onChange

These events have an additional parameter with the currency object.

```tsx
const onFocus = (value, currency) => {}
```

### The currency object

```ts
{
  continent: 'Europe',
  name: 'Norsk krone',
  iso: 'NOK',
  decimals: 2,
  i18n: {
    en: 'Norwegian krone',
    nb: 'Norsk krone',
  },
  regions: ['Scandinavia', 'Nordic']
},
```
