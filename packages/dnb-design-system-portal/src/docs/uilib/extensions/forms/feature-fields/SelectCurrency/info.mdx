## Description

`Field.SelectCurrency` is a wrapper component for [Field.Selection](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/Selection), with options built in for selecting a currency.
[The list of available currencies to select](/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields/SelectCurrency/properties/#list-of-available-currencies) is carefully curated to meet the demands we know today.
When selecting a currency, the value returned is the selected currency's [ISO 4217 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) (currency code) like `NOK` for Norwegian krone.

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.SelectCurrency />)
```

It supports the HTML [autocomplete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) attribute. Consider setting `autoComplete="transaction-currency"` if used to set the currency of a transaction, in a payment form.

There is a corresponding [Value.SelectCurrency](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/SelectCurrency) component.
