## Description

`Field.Autocomplete` is a wrapper component for the original [Autocomplete](/uilib/components/autocomplete) component with integration for the [Form](/uilib/extensions/forms/getting-started) extension.

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.Autocomplete />)
```

## How is this different from `Field.Selection`?

The [Field.Selection](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/Selection/) component with `variant="autocomplete"` can be to create a simple autocomplete.

For complex autocompletes, with e.g asynchronous nature, you can use the `<Field.Autocomplete />` component for more flexibility.
