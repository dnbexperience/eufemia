## Description

`Field.Password` is a wrapper component for the [input of strings](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/String), with user experience tailored for passwords. The input also comes with a button to toggle the password visibility.

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.Password />)
```

## Validation

By default it has no validation. But you can enable it by giving a `required`, `pattern`, `schema`, `onChangeValidator` or `onBlurValidator` property with the needed validation. More about validation in the [Getting Started](/uilib/extensions/forms/getting-started/#validation) section.
