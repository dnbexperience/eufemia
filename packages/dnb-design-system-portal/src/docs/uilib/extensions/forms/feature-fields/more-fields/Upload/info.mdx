## Description

`Field.Upload` is a wrapper for the [Upload](/uilib/components/upload/) component to make it easier to use inside a form.

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.Upload />)
```

## The data and file format

The returned data is an array of objects containing a file object and a unique ID. The file object contains the file itself and some additional properties like an unique ID.

```tsx
{
  id: '1234',
  file: {
    name: 'file1.jpg',
    size: 1234,
    type: 'image/jpeg',
  },
  errorMessage: 'error message ...',
}
```

This data format will be returned by the `onChange` and the `onSubmit` event handlers.

## Validation

The `required` property will validate if there are valid files present. If there are files with an error, the validation will fail.

If there are invalid files, the `onSubmit` event will not be called and a validation error will be shown.

The `onChange` event handler will return an array with objects containing the file object and some additional properties â€“ regardless of the validity of the file.

## About the `value` and `path` property

The `path` property represents an array with an object described above:

```tsx
render(
  <Form.Handler defaultData={{ myFiles: files }}>
    <Field.Upload path="/myFiles" />
  </Form.Handler>,
)
```

The `value` property represents an array with an object described above:

```tsx
render(<Field.Upload value={files} />)
```
