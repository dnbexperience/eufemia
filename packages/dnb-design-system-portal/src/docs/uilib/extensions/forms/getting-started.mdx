<QuickStart />

### Creating forms

To build an entire form, there are surrounding components such as form [Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/Handler) and [Wizard.Container](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Wizard/Container) that make data flow and layout easier and save you a lot of extra code, without compromising flexibility.

The needed styles are included in the Eufemia core package via `dnb-ui-components`.

### State management

The state management is done via the [JSON Pointer](#what-is-a-json-pointer) directive (i.e `path="/firstName"`). This is a standardized way of pointing to a specific part of a JavaScript/JSON object. The JSON Pointer is used to both read and write data, and is also used to validate the data.

<Examples.GettingStarted />

#### Filter data

You can filter data by any given criteria. This is done by adding a `filterData` property with a handler to the [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/Handler/).

The callback function receives the path as the first argument, the value as the second argument, and the related field properties as the third argument. The callback function must return a boolean value or undefined. Return false to exclude an entry.

```tsx
const filterDataHandler = (path, value, props, internal) => {
  if (props.disabled === true) {
    return false
  }
}
render(<Form.Handler filterData={filterDataHandler} />)
```

Here is a working example of how to [filter data](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/Handler/demos/#filter-your-data).

### What is a JSON Pointer?

A [JSON Pointer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-json-pointer-03) is a string of tokens separated by `/` characters, these tokens either specify keys in objects or indexes into arrays.

```ts
const data = {
  foo: {
    bar: [
      {
        baz: 'value',
      },
    ],
  },
}
const pointer = '/foo/bar/0/baz' // points to 'value'
```

### Field components

In short, field components are interactive components that the user can interact with. Read more about fields in the [What are fields?](/uilib/extensions/forms/fields/) section.

### Value components

Beside the interactive [Field](/uilib/extensions/forms/fields/) components, there are also the static [Value](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Value/) components. Use these to show summaries or read-only parts of your application with benefits such as linking to source data and standardized formatting based on the type of data to be displayed.

### Async form behavior

This feature allows you to perform asynchronous operations such as fetching data from an API – without additional state management.

You can enable async form submit behavior on the form [Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/Handler) by using:

```tsx
<Form.Handler onSubmit={async () => {}}>...</Form.Handler>
```

It will disable all fields and show an indicator on the [SubmitButton](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/SubmitButton/) while the **form** is pending ([examples](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/Handler/demos/)).

When using [Wizard.Container](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Wizard/Container/) you can use in addition:

```tsx
<Wizard.Container onStepChange={async () => {}}>...</Wizard.Container>
```

It will disable all fields and show an indicator on the [NextButton](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Wizard/NextButton/) while the **step** is pending ([examples](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Wizard/Container/demos/)).

#### onChange and autosave

You can use an async function for the `onChange` event handler, either on the form [Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/Handler):

```tsx
<Form.Handler onChange={async () => {}}>...</Form.Handler>
```

or on every [field](/uilib/extensions/forms/fields/):

```tsx
<Field.PhoneNumber path="/myField" onChange={async () => {}} />
```

They can be used in combination as well – including [async validator](/uilib/extensions/forms/getting-started/#async-validation) functions.

When the user makes a value change, it will show an indicator on the corresponding field label.

This feature can not only be used for autosave, but for any other real-time async operations.

Here is an example of an async change behavior:

<AsyncChangeExample />

More info about the async change behavior in the form [Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/Handler/info/#async-onchange-and-onsubmit-event-handlers) section.

#### Async field validation

A similar indicator behavior will occur when using async functions for field validation, such as `validator` or `onBlurValidation`, your form will exhibit async behavior. This means that the validation needs to be successfully completed before the form can be submitted.

### Validation and error handling

Every field component has a built-in validation that is based on the type of data it handles. This validation is automatically applied to the field when the user interacts with it. The validation is also applied when the user submits the form.

In addition, you can add your own validation to a field component. This is done by adding a `required`, `pattern`, `schema` or `validator` property.

Fields which have the `disabled` prop or the `readOnly` prop, will skip validation.

For monitoring your form for errors, you can use the [useError](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/useError) hook.

#### required

The required property is a boolean that indicates whether the field is required or not:

```tsx
<Field.PhoneNumber required />
```

#### pattern

The pattern property is a regular expression that the value of the field must match:

```tsx
<Field.PhoneNumber pattern="..." />
```

#### schema

The schema property is a JSON schema that the value of the field must match:

```tsx
const schema = {
  pattern: '...',
}
<Field.PhoneNumber schema={schema} />
```

#### validator

The validator property is a function that takes the current value of the field as an argument and returns an error message if the value is invalid:

```tsx
const validator = (value) => {
  const isInvalid = new RegExp('...').test(value)
  if (isInvalid) {
    return new Error('Invalid value message')
  }
}
;<Field.PhoneNumber validator={validator} />
```

You can find more info about error messages in the [Error messages](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/error-messages/) docs.

##### Async validation

Async validation is also supported. The validator function can return a promise (async/await) that resolves to an error message.

In this example we use `onBlurValidator` to only validate the field when the user leaves the field:

```tsx
const validator = async (value) => {
  try {
    const isInvalid = await makeRequest(value)
    if (isInvalid) {
      return new Error('Invalid value') // Show this message below the field
    }
  } catch (error) {
    return error
  }
}
render(<Field.PhoneNumber onBlurValidator={validator} />)
```

##### Async validator with debounce

While when using async validation on every keystroke, it's a good idea to debounce the validation function to avoid unnecessary requests. This can be done by using the [debounceAsync](/uilib/helpers/functions/#debounce) helper function:

```tsx
import { debounceAsync } from '@dnb/eufemia/shared/helpers'

const validator = debounceAsync(async function myValidator(value) {
  try {
    const isInvalid = await makeRequest(value)
    if (isInvalid) {
      return new Error('Invalid value') // Show this message below the field
    }
  } catch (error) {
    return error
  }
})
render(<Field.PhoneNumber validator={validator} />)
```

### Localization

In short, use the Eufemia [Provider](/uilib/usage/customisation/localization/) to set the locale for your application (forms). This will ensure that the correct language is used for all the fields in your form.

```tsx
import { Provider } from '@dnb/eufemia/shared'

render(
  <Provider locale="en-GB">
    <Field.PhoneNumber />
  </Provider>,
)
```

In addition, you can customize the translations globally:

```tsx
import { Provider } from '@dnb/eufemia/shared'

render(
  <Provider
    locales={{
      'nb-NO': {
        Forms: {
          PhoneNumber: { label: 'Custom' },
        },
      },
    }}
  >
    <Field.PhoneNumber />
  </Provider>,
)
```

Or use the `Form.useLocale` hook to localize [your own field](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/#localization-and-translations).

### Layout

When building your application forms, preferably use the following layout components. They seamlessly places all the fields and components of Eufemia Forms correctly into place.

- [Flex](/uilib/layout/flex) layout component for easy and consistent application forms.
- [Card](/uilib/components/card) for the default card outline of forms.

For changing sizes of e.g. input fields, you may have a look at [Form.Appearance](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/Appearance/).

## Create your own components

Eufemia Forms consists of helper components and tools so you can declaratively create interactive form components that flawlessly integrates between existing data and your custom form components. This ensures a common look and feel, even when ready-made components are combined with your local custom components.
