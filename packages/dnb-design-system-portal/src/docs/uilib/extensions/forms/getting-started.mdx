<QuickStart />

## Creating forms

To build an entire form, there are surrounding components such as form [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler) and [Wizard.Container](/uilib/extensions/forms/Wizard/Container) that make data flow and layout easier and save you a lot of extra code, without compromising flexibility.

The needed styles are included in the Eufemia core package via `dnb-ui-components`.

## TypeScript support

You can define the TypeScript type structure for your form data. This will help you to get better code completion and type checking.

**NB:** Use `type` instead of `interface` for the type definition.

```tsx
import { Form, OnSubmit } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

type MyData = {
  firstName?: string
}

const submitHandler: OnSubmit<MyData> = (data) => {
  console.log(data.firstName satisfies string)
}

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <Form.Handler<MyData> onSubmit={submitHandler}>
      <MyComponent />
    </Form.Handler>
  )
}

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { data } = Form.useData<MyData>()
  return data.firstName
}
```

Read more about TypeScript support and the other methods in the [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/#typescript-support) section or in the [Form.useData](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/useData/#typescript-support) hook docs.

## State management

While you can use a controlled method of handling the sate of fields or your form, it is recommended to use a declarative approach, where you keep the state of your form inside the data context, instead of pulling it out via your own `useState` hooks (imperative).

- You don't need React **useState** to handle your form data.

So how does that work?

Lets say you have a form with a `name` field. In order to tell e.g. the `onSubmit` event what the data structure is, you define a declaration (`path`) about it right on the field itself:

```jsx
<Field.String path="/name" />
```

Why call it `path`?

Because it can describe the structure of the data in several layers deep:

```jsx
<Field.String path="/user/name" />
```

Which results in the following data structure:

```jsx
{
  user: {
    name: 'Hanna'
  }
}
```

Paths of fields (`path="/dataPath"`) must be unique to ensure proper error handling and data input. If Eufemia detects duplicate paths, it will print the following warning in the console: `Eufemia Path declared multiple times: /duplicatePath`.

This is called a [JSON Pointer](#what-is-a-json-pointer), which is a standardized way of pointing to a specific part of a JavaScript/JSON object.

These JSON pointers are used to both read and write data, and is also used to validate the form data.

### What is a JSON Pointer?

A [JSON Pointer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-json-pointer-03) is a string of tokens separated by `/` characters, these tokens either specify keys in objects or indexes in arrays.

```ts
const data = {
  foo: {
    bar: [
      {
        baz: 'value',
      },
    ],
  },
}
const pointer = '/foo/bar/0/baz' // points to 'value'
```

### Data handling

How do I handle complex data logic?

You can show or hide parts of your form based on your own logic. This is done by using the [Form.Visibility](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Visibility/) component (yes, it even can animate the visibility).

And you can access and modify your form data with [Form.useData](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/useData/) or [Form.getData](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/getData/) or even [Form.setData](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/setData/).

Here is an example of how to use these methods:

```jsx
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

const myFormId = 'unique-id' // or a function, object or React Context reference

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <Form.Handler id={myFormId}>
      <MyComponent />
    </Form.Handler>
  )
}

function MyComponent() {
  const {
    getValue,
    update,
    remove,
    set,
    data,
    filterData,
    reduceToVisibleFields,
  } = Form.useData() // optionally provide an id or reference
}

// You can also use the setData:
Form.setData(myFormId, { companyName: 'DNB' })

// ... and the getData – method whenever you need to:
const { getValue, data, filterData, reduceToVisibleFields } =
  Form.getData(myFormId)
```

- `getValue` will return the value of the given path.
- `update` will update the value of the given path.
- `remove` will remove the given path from the data context (fields will reapply their values afterwards).
- `set` will set the whole dataset.
- `data` will return the whole dataset (unvalidated).
- `filterData` will filter the data based on your own logic.
- `reduceToVisibleFields` will reduce the given data set to only contain the visible fields (mounted fields).

As you can see in the code above, you can even handle the state outside the `Form.Handler` context. You find more details on this topic in the [Form.useData](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/useData/) documentation.

<Examples.GettingStarted />

### Filter data

In this section we will show how to filter out some data based on your own logic. You can filter data by any given criteria.

#### Concepts of filtering data

There are many ways to utilize `filterData`, here are some concepts to exclude a data entry:

- When a field is disabled.
- When a field is hidden.
- When a field has an error.
- When a field has a value that matches a given criteria.
- When a field has a path that starts with e.g. `_`.

Here is an example of how to filter data when a path starts with `_`:

```tsx
const filterDataHandler = ({ path }) => {
  if (/\/_/.test(path)) {
    // When returning false, the data entry will be left out
    return false
  }
}

render(
  <Form.Handler
    defaultData={{
      foo: 'foo',
      _bar: 'bar', // Will be excluded
    }}
    onSubmit={(data, { filterData }) => {
      const filteredData = filterData(filterDataHandler)
      console.log(filteredData) // Will be { foo: 'foo' }
    }}
  >
    <MyComponent />
  </Form.Handler>,
)
```

#### How do I use it?

You can utilizing the `filterData` method in:

- [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/#filter-data) component.
- [Form.useData](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/useData/#filter-data) hook.
- [Form.getData](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/getData/#filter-data) method.
- [Form.Visibility](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Visibility/#filter-data) component.

You can provide either an object with the paths (1) or a handler (2).

Here is an example of how to filter data outlining the different ways to filter data:

```tsx
// 1. Method – by using paths (JSON Pointer)
const filterDataPaths = {
  '/foo': ({ value, data, props, error }) => value !== 'bar',
  '/foo': false, // Will exclude the field with the path "/foo"
  '/array/0': false, // Will exclude the first item of the array
  '/array/*/objectKey': false, // Will exclude all objects inside the array with a key of "objectKey"
}

// 2. Method – by using a handler.
// It will iterate over all fields and data entries regardless what path they have.
const filterDataHandler = ({ path, value, data, props, error }) => {
  if (/\/_/.test(path)) {
    // When returning false, the data entry will be left out
    return false
  }
}

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { filterData } = Form.useData()
  const filteredDataA = filterData(filterDataPaths)
  const filteredDataB = filterData(filterDataHandler)
  console.log(filteredDataA)
  console.log(filteredDataB)

  return <Field.String path="/foo" />
}

render(
  <Form.Handler>
    <MyComponent />
  </Form.Handler>,
)
```

You may check out an [interactive example](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/useData/#filter-your-data) of how to filter data.

#### Filter data during submit

When submitting data to the server, you might want to exclude data that has been hidden (unmounted) by the user. You have two built-in options to achieve this:

User entered data will always be stored internally in the data context, even if a [Field](/uilib/extensions/forms/all-fields/) is temporarily shown (mounted/unmounted).

##### The `reduceToVisibleFields` method

You can use the `reduceToVisibleFields` function to get only the data of visible (mounted) fields. Check out the [example](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/demos/#visible-data) in the demo section.

##### The `filterData` method

For filtering data during form submit you can use the `filterData` method given as a parameter to the `onSubmit` ([Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/)) event callback:

```tsx
render(
  <Form.Handler
    onSubmit={(data, { filterData }) => {
      // Same method as in the previous example
      const filteredDataA = filterData(filterDataPaths)
      const filteredDataB = filterData(filterDataHandler)
      console.log(filteredDataA)
      console.log(filteredDataB)
    }}
  >
    <Field.String path="/foo" />
  </Form.Handler>,
)
```

You may check out an [interactive example](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/demos/#filter-your-data) of how to filter data during the submit event.

### Transforming data

Each [Field.\*](/uilib/extensions/forms/all-fields/) and [Value.\*](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/) component supports transformer functions.

These functions allow you to manipulate the field value to a different format than it uses internally and vice versa.

```tsx
<Field.String
  path="/myField"
  transformOut={transformOut}
  transformIn={transformIn}
/>
```

- `transformOut` (out of the `Field.*` component) transforms the internal value before it gets forwarded to the data context or returned as e.g. the `onChange` value parameter.
- `transformIn` (in to the `Field.*` or `Value.*` component) transforms the external value before it is displayed and used internally.

<Examples.Transformers />

#### Complex objects in the data context

If you need to store complex objects in the data context instead of simple values like strings, numbers, or booleans, you can use transformer functions.

Suppose you want to store a country object instead of just a country code like `NO` or `SV` when using [Field.SelectCountry](/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields/SelectCountry/).

You can achieve this by using the `transformIn` and `transformOut` functions:

```tsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
import type { CountryType } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms/Field/SelectCountry'

// From the Field (internal value) to the data context or event parameter
const transformOut = (internal, country) => {
  if (internal) {
    return country
  }
}

// To the Field (from e.g. defaultValue)
const transformIn = (external: CountryType) => {
  return external?.iso || 'NO'
}

const MyForm = () => {
  return (
    <Form.Handler>
      <Field.SelectCountry
        path="/country"
        transformIn={transformIn}
        transformOut={transformOut}
        defaultValue="NO"
      />

      <Value.SelectCountry path="/country" transformIn={transformIn} />
    </Form.Handler>
  )
}
```

## Async form handling

It depends on your use case if this feature is needed. But when it is, it's often a time consuming task to implement. Eufemia Forms has therefor a built-in feature that enables async form behavior.

More details about the async form behavior can be found in the [async form behavior](/uilib/extensions/forms/getting-started/#async-form-behavior) section.

## Field components

In short, field components are interactive components that the user can interact with. Read more about fields in the [What are fields?](/uilib/extensions/forms/about-fields/) section.

## Value components

Beside the interactive [Field](/uilib/extensions/forms/all-fields/) components, there is also the static [Value](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/) components. Use these to show summaries or read-only parts of your application with benefits such as linking to source data and standardized formatting based on the type of data to be displayed.

### Inherit visibility from fields

User entered data will always be stored internally in the data context, even if a [Field](/uilib/extensions/forms/all-fields/) is temporarily shown (mounted/unmounted).

`Value.*` components will render the value regardless of the visibility of the field.

You can use the `inheritVisibility` property on the [Value.\*](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/) components to inherit the visibility from the field with the same path.

## Conditionally display content

You can conditionally display content using the [Form.Visibility](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Visibility/) component. This allows you to show or hide its children based on the validation (A.) or the value (B.) of another path (data entry).

```tsx
<Form.Visibility
  animate
  visibleWhen={{
    path: '/myField',
    hasValue: (value) => value === 'foo', // A. Value based
    isValid: true, // B. Validation based
  }}
>
  <Field.String path="/myField" />
</Form.Visibility>
```

## Async form behavior

This feature allows you to perform asynchronous operations such as fetching data from an API – without additional state management.

You can enable async form submit behavior on the form [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler) by using:

```tsx
<Form.Handler onSubmit={async () => {}}>...</Form.Handler>
```

It will disable all fields and show an indicator on the [Form.SubmitButton](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/SubmitButton/) while the **form** is pending ([examples](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/demos/)).

When using [Wizard.Container](/uilib/extensions/forms/Wizard/Container/) you can use in addition:

```tsx
<Wizard.Container onStepChange={async () => {}}>...</Wizard.Container>
```

It will disable all fields and show an indicator on the [Wizard.NextButton](/uilib/extensions/forms/Wizard/NextButton/) while the **step** is pending ([examples](/uilib/extensions/forms/Wizard/Container/demos/)).

### onChange and autosave

You can use an async function for the `onChange` event handler, either on the form [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler):

```tsx
<Form.Handler onChange={async () => {}}>...</Form.Handler>
```

or on every [field](/uilib/extensions/forms/all-fields/):

```tsx
<Field.PhoneNumber path="/myField" onChange={async () => {}} />
```

They can be used in combination as well – including [async validator](/uilib/extensions/forms/getting-started/#async-validation) functions.

When the user makes a value change, it will show an indicator on the corresponding field label.

This feature cannot only be used for autosave, but for any other real-time async operations.

Here is an example of an async change behavior:

<AsyncChangeExample />

More info about the async change behavior in the form [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/info/#async-onchange-and-onsubmit-event-handlers) section.

### Async field validation

A similar indicator behavior will occur when using async functions for field validation, such as `onChangeValidator` or `onBlurValidation`, your form will exhibit async behavior. This means that the validation needs to be successfully completed before the form can be submitted.

## Validation and error handling

Every field component has a built-in validation that is based on the type of data it handles. This validation is automatically applied to the field when the user interacts with it. The validation is also applied when the user submits the form.

In addition, you can add your own validation to a field component. This is done by adding a `required`, `pattern`, `schema`, `onChangeValidator` or `onBlurValidation` property.

Fields which have the `disabled` property or the `readOnly` property, will skip validation.

For monitoring and setting your form errors, you can use the [useValidation](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/useValidation) hook.

### Validation and the user experience (UX)

Eufemia Forms provides a built-in validation system that is based on the type of data it handles. This validation is automatically applied to the field when the user interacts with it. The validation is also applied when the user submits the form.

In general, the validation is based on the following principles:

- Trust the user and assume they are doing their best.
- Avoid interrupting the user while they are entering data.
- Provide clear and concise error messages, ending with a period.

The validation system is flexible and can be customized to fit your specific needs. You can add your own validation to a field component by using the `required`, `pattern`, `schema`, `onChangeValidator` or `onBlurValidation` property.

### Validation order

If there are multiple errors, they will be shown in a specific order, and only the first error in that order will appear.

The validation order is as follows:

1. `required`
2. `error` (with `conditionally`)
3. `schema` (including `pattern`)
4. `onChangeValidator`
5. `onBlurValidator`

### Error messages

Eufemia Forms comes with built-in error messages. But you can also customize and override these messages by using the `errorMessages` property both on [fields](/uilib/extensions/forms/all-fields/) (field level) and on the [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/) (global level).

You may use the `errorMessages` property for two purposes:

- Provide your onw error messages.
- Overwrite the default error messages.

Both can be done on a global level or on a field level.

How ever, for when overwriting the default error messages on a global level, you can also use [internationalization (i18n)](#localization-and-translation).

Read more about [error messages](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/error-messages/).

### Summary for errors

To improve user experience communication regarding errors and their locations, WCAG/UU suggests summarizing error messages when errors have occurred.

Eufemia Forms will easily link up with the [GlobalStatus](/uilib/components/global-status) component and will only display it if there are errors or when the form is being submitted.

```tsx
<GlobalStatus />

<Form.Handler>
  My Form
</Form.Handler>
```

If you need a custom unique ID, you can just assign `globalStatusId` to the `Form.Handler`:

```tsx
<GlobalStatus id="my-form-status" />

<Form.Handler globalStatusId="my-form-status">
  My Form
</Form.Handler>
```

### required

The `required` property is a boolean that indicates whether the field is required or not:

```tsx
<Field.PhoneNumber required />
```

**Note:** You can use the `required` property on the [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/) or [Wizard.Step](/uilib/extensions/forms/Wizard/Step/) components ([example](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/demos/#required-and-optional-fields)). Additionally, the [Form.Section](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Section/) component as well as the [Field.Provider](/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields/Provider/) provider has a `required` property, which will make all nested fields within that section required.

```tsx
<Form.Handler required>
  <Field.PhoneNumber />
  <Field.String />
</Form.Handler>
```

When you need to opt-out of the required field validation, you can use the `required={false}` property. This will also add a "(optional)" suffix to the field label(`labelSuffix`).

```tsx
<Form.Handler required>
  <Field.String label="I'm required" />
  <Field.String label="I'm not" required={false} />
  <Field.Email required={false} labelSuffix="(recommended)" />
</Form.Handler>
```

### pattern

The `pattern` property is a regular expression (RegExp) that the value of the field must match:

```tsx
<Field.PhoneNumber pattern="Your RegExp" />
```

### schema

The `schema` property is a JSON schema that the value of the field must match:

```tsx
const schema = {
  /* AJV Schema */
}
<Field.PhoneNumber schema={schema} />
```

### onBlurValidator and onChangeValidator

The `onBlurValidator` and `onChangeValidator` properties accepts a function that takes the current value of the field as an argument and returns an error message if the value is invalid:

```tsx
const onChangeValidator = (value) => {
  const isInvalid = new RegExp('Your RegExp').test(value)
  if (isInvalid) {
    return new Error('Invalid value message')
  }
}
render(<Field.PhoneNumber onChangeValidator={onChangeValidator} />)
```

You can find more info about error messages in the [error messages](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/error-messages/) docs.

#### Connect with another field

You can also use the `connectWithPath` (or `connectWithItemPath` for within [Iterate.Array](/uilib/extensions/forms/Iterate/Array/)) function to connect the validator (`onChangeValidator` and `onBlurValidator`) to another field. This allows you to rerun the validator function once the value of the connected field changes:

```tsx
import { Form, Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

const onChangeValidator = (value, { connectWithPath }) => {
  const { getValue } = connectWithPath('/myReference')
  const amount = getValue()
  if (amount >= value) {
    return new Error(`The amount should be greater than ${amount}`)
  }
}

render(
  <Form.Handler>
    <Field.Number path="/myReference" defaultValue={2} />

    <Field.Number
      path="/withOnChangeValidator"
      defaultValue={2}
      onChangeValidator={onChangeValidator} // NB: You may use "onBlurValidator" depending on use case.
    />
  </Form.Handler>,
)
```

By default, the `onChangeValidator` function will only run when the "/withOnChangeValidator" field is changed. When the error message is shown, it will update the message with the new value of the "/myReference" field.

You can also change this behavior for testing purposes by using the following properties:

- `validateInitially` will run the validation initially.
- `validateContinuously` will run the validation on every change, including when the connected field changes.
- `validateUnchanged` will validate without any changes made by the user, including when the connected field changes.

#### Async validation

Async validation is also supported. The validator function can return a promise (async/await) that resolves to an error message.

In this example we use `onBlurValidator` to only validate the field when the user leaves the field:

```tsx
const onChangeValidator = async (value) => {
  try {
    const isInvalid = await makeRequest(value)
    if (isInvalid) {
      return new Error('Invalid value') // Show this message below the field
    }
  } catch (error) {
    return error
  }
}
render(<Field.PhoneNumber onBlurValidator={onChangeValidator} />)
```

#### Async validator with debounce

While when using async validation on every keystroke, it's a good idea to debounce the validation function to avoid unnecessary requests. This can be done by using the [debounceAsync](/uilib/helpers/functions/#debounce) helper function:

```tsx
import { debounceAsync } from '@dnb/eufemia/shared/helpers'

const onChangeValidator = debounceAsync(async function myValidator(value) {
  try {
    const isInvalid = await makeRequest(value)
    if (isInvalid) {
      return new Error('Invalid value') // Show this message below the field
    }
  } catch (error) {
    return error
  }
})
render(<Field.PhoneNumber onChangeValidator={onChangeValidator} />)
```

### error

The `error` property is a controlled error message that is always displayed by default.

```tsx
render(<Field.String error={new Error('Invalid value')} />)
```

You can also provide the error message as a string:

```tsx
render(<Field.String error="Invalid value" />)
```

Or as a React.Element:

```tsx
render(
  <Field.String
    error={
      <>
        A <strong>formatted</strong> error message.
      </>
    }
  />,
)
```

As well as an array with multiple error messages:

```tsx
render(
  <Field.String
    error={[
      'First error message',
      <>
        Second <strong>formatted</strong> error message.
      </>,
      new Error('Third error message'),
      new FormError('fourth.message'),
      new FormError('fifth.message'),
    ]}
    errorMessages={{
      'fourth.message': 'Fourth error message',
      'fifth.message': (
        <>
          Fifth <strong>formatted</strong> error message.
        </>
      ),
    }}
  />,
)
```

## Conditionally display messages

You can provide a function to the `info`, `warning` and `error` properties to conditionally change this behavior based on specific requirements.

Using this `conditional` function, the error message (or info or warning message) will only be shown after the user interacts with the field — for instance, after they change its value and move focus away (blur). This allows you to display error messages dynamically, ensuring they appear only when the field's value is invalid and the user has engaged with it.

```tsx
render(
  <Field.Number
    error={(value, { conditionally }) => {
      if (value === 123) {
        return conditionally(() => new Error('Invalid value'))
      }
    }}
  />,
)
```

More info about it in the [Field.Number](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/Number/) component.

## Country specific validation

You can change the country used for your form by setting the `countryCode` property on the [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/) component.

Fields that support the `countryCode` property will use the country code from the data context and adjust their behavior accordingly. Read more about the specific behavior changes in their respective documentation.

## Localization and translation

You can set the locale for your form by using the `locale` property on the [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/) component. This will ensure that the correct language is used for all the fields in your form.

```tsx
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <Form.Handler locale="en-GB">
      <Field.PhoneNumber />
    </Form.Handler>
  )
}
```

### Translations provided by Eufemia

Eufemia provides forms translations for the following locales:

<Ul>
  {Object.keys(languageDisplayNames).map((l) => (
    <Li key={l}>
      <Anchor
        href={`https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia/blob/main/packages/dnb-eufemia/src/extensions/forms/constants/locales/${l}.ts`}
      >
        {l}
      </Anchor>
    </Li>
  ))}
</Ul>

### Add additional translations

```js
import { mergeTranslations } from '@dnb/eufemia/shared'
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/src/extensions/forms'
import svSE_forms from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms/constants/locales/sv-SE'
import svSE_forms_countries from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms/constants/locales/countries/sv-SE'
// or import danish translations, like so:
import daDK_forms from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms/constants/locales/da-DK'
import daDK_forms_countries from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms/constants/locales/countries/da-DK'

const translations = mergeTranslations(svSE_forms, svSE_forms_countries)

render(
  <Form.Handler translations={translations} locale="sv-SE">
    Your form
  </Form.Handler>,
)
```

Instead of providing the forms translations per form, you can also provide them globally using the `Provider` component.

If so, you can use the `mergeTranslations` function from `@dnb/eufemia/shared` to merge the forms translations with the shared translations like this:

```js
import { Provider, mergeTranslations } from '@dnb/eufemia/shared'
import svSE from '@dnb/eufemia/shared/locales/sv-SE'
import svSE_forms from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms/constants/locales/sv-SE'

const translations = mergeTranslations(svSE, svSE_forms)

render(
  <Provider translations={translations} locale="sv-SE">
    Your app, including Eufemia Forms
  </Provider>,
)
```

### Customize translations

You can customize the internal translations in a flat structure (dot-notation):

```tsx
{
  'nb-NO': { 'PhoneNumber.label': 'Egendefinert' },
  'en-GB': { 'PhoneNumber.label': 'Custom' },
}
```

or an object based structure:

```tsx
{
  'nb-NO': { PhoneNumber: { label: 'Egendefinert' } },
  'en-GB': { PhoneNumber: { label: 'Custom' } },
}
```

### How to customize translations in a form

You can customize the translations in a form by using the `translations` property on the [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/).

Alternatively, you can use the global Eufemia [Provider](/uilib/usage/customisation/provider/).

You can find all available strings and keys in the properties tab of each field or value component. For example, check out the [PhoneNumber field properties](#!/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields/PhoneNumber/properties/#translations).

```tsx
import { Form, Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

const myTranslations = {
  'nb-NO': { 'PhoneNumber.label': 'Egendefinert' },
  'en-GB': { 'PhoneNumber.label': 'Custom' },
}

render(
  <Form.Handler translations={myTranslations}>
    <Field.PhoneNumber />
  </Form.Handler>,
)
```

#### Consume the translations

You can consume both the internal or your own translations with the [Form.useTranslation](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/useTranslation/) hook:

```tsx
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

const myTranslations = {
  'nb-NO': { myString: 'Min egendefinerte streng' },
  'en-GB': {
    // Cascaded translations
    Nested: {
      stringWithArgs: 'My custom string with an argument: {myKey}',
    },

    // Flat translations
    'Nested.stringWithLinebreaks':
      'My custom string with a {br}line-break',
  },
}

const MyComponent = () => {
  const t = Form.useTranslation<typeof myTranslations>()

  // Internal translations
  const existingString = t.Field.errorRequired

  // Your translations
  const myString = t.myString

  // Use the "formatMessage" function to handle strings with arguments
  const myStringWithArgsA = t.formatMessage(t.Nested.stringWithArgs, {
    myKey: 'myValue',
  })
  // You can also get the string with a key (dot-notation)
  const myStringWithArgsB = t.formatMessage('Nested.stringWithArgs', {
    myKey: 'myValue',
  })

  // Render line-breaks
  const jsxOutput = t.renderMessage(t.Nested.stringWithLinebreaks)

  return <>MyComponent</>
}

render(
  <Form.Handler translations={myTranslations}>
    <MyComponent />
  </Form.Handler>,
)
```

Here is a [demo](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/demos/#locale-and-translations) of how to use the translations in a form.

When creating [your own field](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/#localization-and-translations), you can use the `Form.useTranslation` hook to localize your field.

## Layout

When building your application forms, preferably use the following layout components. They seamlessly places all the fields and components of Eufemia Forms correctly into place.

- [Flex.Stack](/uilib/layout/flex/stack/) layout component for easy and consistent application forms.
- [Form.Card](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Card/) with the stack property `<Form.Card>...</Form.Card>` for the default card outline of forms.
- [Form.Appearance](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Appearance/) for changing sizes (height) of e.g. input fields.

## Best practices

- [Best practices on Forms](/uilib/extensions/forms/best-practices-on-forms/).

## Debugging

### Logging

You can use the `Tools.Log` component to log data to the console. The whole data context will be logged.

```tsx
import { Tools } from '@dnb/eufemia/src/extensions/forms'

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <Form.Handler>
      <Tools.Log />

      <Form.Isolation>
        <Tools.Log />
      </Form.Isolation>
    </Form.Handler>
  )
}
```

You can also provide your own data to the `Tools.Log` component by using the `data` property.

### Finding errors

In order to debug your forms, you can use the `Tools.Errors` component. It will render a list of all errors in your form, including the field path and the error message.

- `fieldErrors` will render all field errors.
- `formErrors` will render all form errors initiated by e.g. `schema`.

```tsx
import { Tools } from '@dnb/eufemia/src/extensions/forms'

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <Form.Handler>
      <Tools.Errors />
    </Form.Handler>
  )
}
```

## Create your own component

Eufemia Forms consists of helper components and tools so you can declaratively create interactive form components that flawlessly integrates between existing data and your custom form components. This ensures a common look and feel, even when ready-made components are combined with your local custom components.
