The needed styles are included in the Eufemia core package via `dnb-ui-components`.

### Creating forms

To build an entire form, there are surrounding components such as [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/Handler) and [StepsLayout](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/StepsLayout) that make data flow and layout easier and save you a lot of extra code, without compromising flexibility.

### State management

The state management is done via the [JSON Pointer](#what-is-a-json-pointer) directive (i.e `path="/firstName"`). This is a standardized way of pointing to a specific part of a JavaScript/JSON object. The JSON Pointer is used to both read and write data, and is also used to validate the data.

<Examples.GettingStarted />

You find more details in the [useData](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Form/useData/) docs.

### What is a JSON Pointer?

A [JSON Pointer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-json-pointer-03) is a string of tokens separated by `/` characters, these tokens either specify keys in objects or indexes into arrays.

```ts
const data = {
  foo: {
    bar: [
      {
        baz: 'value',
      },
    ],
  },
}
const pointer = '/foo/bar/0/baz' // points to 'value'
```

### Field components

The data-driven [base field components](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields) are named and structured according to the type of data they can display and produce based on the user's input and action in the interface.

On top of these, a number of [feature fields](/uilib/extensions/forms/feature-fields) have been built that have special functionality based on given types of data, such as bank account numbers, e-mails and social security numbers.

### Value components

Beside the interactive [Field](/uilib/extensions/forms/fields/) components, there are also the static [Value](/uilib/extensions/forms/extended-features/Value/) components. Use these to show summaries or read-only parts of your application with benefits such as linking to source data and standardized formatting based on the type of data to be displayed.

### Layout

When building your application forms, preferably use the following layout components. They seamlessly places all the fields and components of Eufemia Forms correctly into place.

- [Flex](/uilib/layout/flex) layout component for easy and consistent application forms.
- [Card](/uilib/components/card) for the default card outline of forms.

### Best practices

- [Best practices on Forms](/uilib/extensions/forms/best-practices-on-forms/).

## Create your own components

Eufemia Forms consists of helper components and tools so you can declaratively create interactive form components that flawlessly integrates between existing data and your custom form components. This ensures a common look and feel, even when ready-made components are combined with your local custom components.
