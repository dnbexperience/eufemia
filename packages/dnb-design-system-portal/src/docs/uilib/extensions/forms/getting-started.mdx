<QuickStart />

### Creating forms

To build an entire form, there are surrounding components such as form [Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler) and [Wizard.Container](/uilib/extensions/forms/Wizard/Container) that make data flow and layout easier and save you a lot of extra code, without compromising flexibility.

The needed styles are included in the Eufemia core package via `dnb-ui-components`.

### State management

While you can use a controlled method of handling the sate of fields or your form, it is recommended to use a declarative approach, where you keep the state of your form inside the data context, instead of pulling it out via your own `useState` hooks (imperative).

- You don't need React **useState** to handle your form data.

So how does that work?

Lets say you have a form with a `name` field. In order to tell e.g. the `onSubmit` event what the data structure is, you define a declaration (`path`) about it right on the field itself:

```jsx
<Field.String path="/name" />
```

Why call it `path`?

Because it can describe the structure of the data in several layers deep:

```jsx
<Field.String path="/user/name" />
```

Which results in the following data structure:

```jsx
{
  user: {
    name: 'Hanna'
  }
}
```

This is called a [JSON Pointer](#what-is-a-json-pointer), which is a standardized way of pointing to a specific part of a JavaScript/JSON object.

These JSON pointers are used to both read and write data, and is also used to validate the form data.

#### What is a JSON Pointer?

A [JSON Pointer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-json-pointer-03) is a string of tokens separated by `/` characters, these tokens either specify keys in objects or indexes in arrays.

```ts
const data = {
  foo: {
    bar: [
      {
        baz: 'value',
      },
    ],
  },
}
const pointer = '/foo/bar/0/baz' // points to 'value'
```

#### Data handling

How do I handle complex data logic?

You can show or hide parts of your form based on your own logic. This is done by using the [Visibility](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Visibility/) component (yes, it even can animate the visibility).

And you can access and modify your form data with [useData](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/useData/) or [getData](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/getData/) or even [setData](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/setData/).

Here is an example of how to use these methods:

```jsx
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <Form.Handler id="unique-id">
      <MyComponent />
    </Form.Handler>
  )
}

function MyComponent() {
  const {
    getValue, // Method to get a single value
    update, // Method to update a single value
    set, // Method to set the whole dataset
    data, // The whole dataset (unvalidated)
    filterData, // Method to filter data with your own logic
  } = Form.useData() // optionally provide an id (unique-id)
}

// You canalso use the setData:
Form.setData('unique-id', { companyName: 'DNB' })

// ... and the getData – method when ever you need to:
const {
  getValue, // Method to get a single value
  data, // The whole dataset (unvalidated)
  filterData, // Method to filter data with your own logic
} = Form.getData('unique-id')
```

As you can see in the code above, you can even handle the state outside the `Form.Handler` context. You find more details on this topic in the [useData](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/useData/) documentation.

<Examples.GettingStarted />

#### Filter data

The internal data will always contain all the fields, even if they are not visible. But you may want to filter out some data based on your own logic.

You can filter data by any given criteria. This is done by utilizing the `filterData` method from e.g.:

- [useData](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/useData/#filter-data) hook.
- [getData](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/getData/#filter-data) method.
- [Visibility](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Visibility/#filter-data) component.

You can provide either a function or an object with the paths you want to filter out.

Here is an example of how filter out fields based on their `path` and `value`:

```tsx
// Method A – if you know the paths
const filterDataPaths = {
  '/foo': ({ value, data, props, internal }) => value !== 'bar',
}

// Method B – will iterate over all fields regardless of the path
const filterDataHandler = ({ path, value, data, props, internal }) =>
  value !== 'bar'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { filterData } = Form.useData()
  const filteredDataA = filterData(filterDataPaths)
  const filteredDataB = filterData(filterDataHandler)
  console.log(filteredDataA)
  console.log(filteredDataB)

  return <Field.String path="/foo" />
}

render(
  <Form.Handler>
    <MyComponent />
  </Form.Handler>,
)
```

You may check out an [interactive example](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/useData/#filter-your-data) of how to filter data.

##### Filter data during submit

For filtering data during form submit (`onSubmit`), you can use the `filterSubmitData` property from:

- [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/)

You may check out an [interactive example](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/demos/#filter-your-data) of how to filter data during the submit event.

#### Transforming data

Each [field](/uilib/extensions/forms/all-fields/) supports transformer functions. So you can transform a value before it is processed to the form data object and vis-a-versa:

```tsx
<Field.String
  label="Label"
  path="/myField"
  transformIn={transformIn}
  transformOut={transformOut}
/>
```

<Examples.Transformers />

### Async form handling

It depends on your use case if this feature is needed. But when it is, its ofter a time consuming task to implement. Eufemia Forms has therefor a built-in feature that enables async form behavior.

More details about the async form behavior can be found in the [async form behavior](/uilib/extensions/forms/getting-started/#async-form-behavior) section.

### Field components

In short, field components are interactive components that the user can interact with. Read more about fields in the [What are fields?](/uilib/extensions/forms/about-fields/) section.

### Value components

Beside the interactive [Field](/uilib/extensions/forms/all-fields/) components, there is also the static [Value](/uilib/extensions/forms/Value/) components. Use these to show summaries or read-only parts of your application with benefits such as linking to source data and standardized formatting based on the type of data to be displayed.

### Async form behavior

This feature allows you to perform asynchronous operations such as fetching data from an API – without additional state management.

You can enable async form submit behavior on the form [Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler) by using:

```tsx
<Form.Handler onSubmit={async () => {}}>...</Form.Handler>
```

It will disable all fields and show an indicator on the [SubmitButton](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/SubmitButton/) while the **form** is pending ([examples](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/demos/)).

When using [Wizard.Container](/uilib/extensions/forms/Wizard/Container/) you can use in addition:

```tsx
<Wizard.Container onStepChange={async () => {}}>...</Wizard.Container>
```

It will disable all fields and show an indicator on the [NextButton](/uilib/extensions/forms/Wizard/Buttons/) while the **step** is pending ([examples](/uilib/extensions/forms/Wizard/Container/demos/)).

#### onChange and autosave

You can use an async function for the `onChange` event handler, either on the form [Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler):

```tsx
<Form.Handler onChange={async () => {}}>...</Form.Handler>
```

or on every [field](/uilib/extensions/forms/all-fields/):

```tsx
<Field.PhoneNumber path="/myField" onChange={async () => {}} />
```

They can be used in combination as well – including [async validator](/uilib/extensions/forms/getting-started/#async-validation) functions.

When the user makes a value change, it will show an indicator on the corresponding field label.

This feature can not only be used for autosave, but for any other real-time async operations.

Here is an example of an async change behavior:

<AsyncChangeExample />

More info about the async change behavior in the form [Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/info/#async-onchange-and-onsubmit-event-handlers) section.

#### Async field validation

A similar indicator behavior will occur when using async functions for field validation, such as `validator` or `onBlurValidation`, your form will exhibit async behavior. This means that the validation needs to be successfully completed before the form can be submitted.

### Validation and error handling

Every field component has a built-in validation that is based on the type of data it handles. This validation is automatically applied to the field when the user interacts with it. The validation is also applied when the user submits the form.

In addition, you can add your own validation to a field component. This is done by adding a `required`, `pattern`, `schema` or `validator` property.

Fields which have the `disabled` prop or the `readOnly` prop, will skip validation.

For monitoring and set your form errors, you can use the [useError](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/useError) hook.

#### Summary for errors

To improve user experience communication regarding errors and their locations, WCAG/UU suggests summarizing error messages when errors have occurred.

Eufemia Forms will easily link up with the [GlobalStatus](/uilib/components/global-status) component and will only display it if there are errors or when the form is being submitted.

```tsx
<GlobalStatus />

<Form.Handler >
  My Form
</Form.Handler>
```

If you need a custom unique ID, you can just assign `globalStatusId` to the `Form.Handler`:

```tsx
<GlobalStatus id="my-form-status" />

<Form.Handler globalStatusId="my-form-status">
  My Form
</Form.Handler>
```

#### required

The `required` property is a boolean that indicates whether the field is required or not:

```tsx
<Field.PhoneNumber required />
```

**NB:** You can also use the `required` property on the [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/) component, [Wizard.Step](/uilib/extensions/forms/Wizard/Step/) component or nested in the [Form.FieldProps](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/FieldProps/) component.

#### pattern

The `pattern` property is a regular expression (RegExp) that the value of the field must match:

```tsx
<Field.PhoneNumber pattern="Your RegExp" />
```

#### schema

The `schema` property is a JSON schema that the value of the field must match:

```tsx
const schema = {
  /* AJV Schema */
}
<Field.PhoneNumber schema={schema} />
```

#### validator

The `validator` (including `onBlurValidator`) property is a function that takes the current value of the field as an argument and returns an error message if the value is invalid:

```tsx
const validator = (value) => {
  const isInvalid = new RegExp('Your RegExp').test(value)
  if (isInvalid) {
    return new Error('Invalid value message')
  }
}
render(<Field.PhoneNumber validator={validator} />)
```

You can find more info about error messages in the [Error messages](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/error-messages/) docs.

##### Async validation

Async validation is also supported. The validator function can return a promise (async/await) that resolves to an error message.

In this example we use `onBlurValidator` to only validate the field when the user leaves the field:

```tsx
const validator = async (value) => {
  try {
    const isInvalid = await makeRequest(value)
    if (isInvalid) {
      return new Error('Invalid value') // Show this message below the field
    }
  } catch (error) {
    return error
  }
}
render(<Field.PhoneNumber onBlurValidator={validator} />)
```

##### Async validator with debounce

While when using async validation on every keystroke, it's a good idea to debounce the validation function to avoid unnecessary requests. This can be done by using the [debounceAsync](/uilib/helpers/functions/#debounce) helper function:

```tsx
import { debounceAsync } from '@dnb/eufemia/shared/helpers'

const validator = debounceAsync(async function myValidator(value) {
  try {
    const isInvalid = await makeRequest(value)
    if (isInvalid) {
      return new Error('Invalid value') // Show this message below the field
    }
  } catch (error) {
    return error
  }
})
render(<Field.PhoneNumber validator={validator} />)
```

### Localization (locale) and translation

You can set the locale for your form by using the `locale` property on the [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/) component. This will ensure that the correct language is used for all the fields in your form.

```tsx
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <Form.Handler locale="en-GB">
      <Field.PhoneNumber />
    </Form.Handler>
  )
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the global Eufemia [Provider](/uilib/usage/customisation/localization/) to set the locale for your application (forms). The locale will be inherited by all the components in your form.

#### Localization with translation

In addition, you can customize the translations:

```tsx
const myTranslations = {
  'nb-NO': { PhoneNumber: { label: 'Egendefinert' } },
  'en-GB': { PhoneNumber: { label: 'Custom' } },
}

render(
  <Form.Handler translations={myTranslations}>
    <Field.PhoneNumber />
  </Form.Handler>,
)
```

Here is an [example](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/demos/#locale-and-translations) of how to use the translations in a form.

When creating [your own field](/uilib/extensions/forms/create-component/#localization-and-translations), you can use the `Form.useTranslation` hook to localize your field.

### Layout

When building your application forms, preferably use the following layout components. They seamlessly places all the fields and components of Eufemia Forms correctly into place.

- [Flex.Stack](/uilib/layout/flex/stack/) layout component for easy and consistent application forms.
- [Card](/uilib/components/card/) with the stack property `<Card stack>...</Card>` for the default card outline of forms.
- [Form.Appearance](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Appearance/) for changing sizes (height) of e.g. input fields.

## Create your own componet

Eufemia Forms consists of helper components and tools so you can declaratively create interactive form components that flawlessly integrates between existing data and your custom form components. This ensures a common look and feel, even when ready-made components are combined with your local custom components.
