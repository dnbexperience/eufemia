## Description

Reusable components for data input, data display and surrounding layout for simplified user interface creation in React, built on top of base Eufemia components.

The goal of the Forms extension is to make it easy to build forms and other data input features in DNB applications built with React.

The components constitute flexible building blocks that can be used individually, or together for a more practical data flow. They must also be easy to combine with components from other sources and local functionality in the individual application.

### Data driven and loosely coupled

The components in Forms are data-driven. This means that they are built on the premises of the source data.

A form in a web application usually consists of two "steps". Data in, preferably from a database or a default data set to be distributed in fields on the screen, and data out, where what the user has typed or selected in the components must be collected in a corresponding data set before it is stored or sent to an API.

### How to use

```jsx
import '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms/style'
import {
  Field,
  Value,
  Layout,
  DataContext,
  StepsLayout,
  ...
} from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
```
