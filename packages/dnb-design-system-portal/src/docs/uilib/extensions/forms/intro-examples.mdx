## Demos

Here are some examples and case demos (fullscreen) of how you can use the form components.

- [Case Demo 1 (fullscreen)](/uilib/extensions/forms/demo-cases/casedemo1/)
- [Case Demo 2 (fullscreen)](/uilib/extensions/forms/demo-cases/casedemo2/)

## Base field components

Base field components are targeting the data type they produce. They can
receive values and change handlers directly by props.

<Examples.BaseFieldComponents />

## Feature fields

Feature fields build on top of base field components and provide standard
props for simplified form implementations.

<Examples.FeatureFields />

## Layout components

Wrapping inputs in [Flex.Stack](/uilib/layout/flex/stack/) and [Card](/uilib/components/card/) with the `stack` property, provides the standard design without
the need for local styles.

<Examples.LayoutComponents />

## Visibility based on data

Certain fields are displayed based on specific data requirements.

<Examples.VisibilityBasedOnData />

## Validation

Here are some examples of validation properties of field components.

<Examples.Validation />

## Using [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/)

Wrapping fields with a [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/) component lets them read and
write data to one common data set, and have input and output of data in
one place instead of connecting to every single field component.
