## Demos

Here are some examples and case demos (fullscreen) of how you can use the form components.

- [Case Demo 1 (fullscreen)](/uilib/extensions/forms/demo-cases/casedemo1/)
- [Case Demo 2 (fullscreen)](/uilib/extensions/forms/demo-cases/casedemo2/)

## Base field components

Base field components are targeting the data type they produce. They can
receive values and change handlers directly by properties.

<Examples.BaseFieldComponents />

## Feature fields

Feature fields build on top of base field components and provide standard
properties for simplified form implementations.

<Examples.FeatureFields />

## Layout components

Wrapping inputs in [Flex.Stack](/uilib/layout/flex/stack/) and [Form.Card](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Card/) with the `stack` property, provides the standard design without
the need for local styles.

<Examples.LayoutComponents />

## Visibility based on data

Certain fields are displayed based on specific data requirements.

<Examples.VisibilityBasedOnData />

## Validation

Here are some examples of validation properties of field components.

<Examples.Validation />

## Using [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/)

Wrapping fields with a [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/) component lets them read and
write data to one common data set, and have input and output of data in
one place instead of connecting to every single field component.

<Examples.UsingFormHandler />

## Using Wizard

With a [Wizard](/uilib/extensions/forms/Wizard/Container) component, you can create a wizard-like flow of steps.

<Examples.UsingWizard />

## Using a Form.Section

With a [Form.Section](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Section) component, you can create a section of fields and values that can be reused in different contexts. It also lets you define a container for the section, so you can easily switch between an edit and a view container.

<Examples.UsingFormSection />

## Iterate over repeated data

You can use the [Iterate](/uilib/extensions/forms/Iterate/) component to iterate over repeated data. It also lets you define animated containers, so you can easily switch between an edit and a view container.

<Examples.UsingIterate />
