# Intro examples

## Base field components

Base field components are targeting the data type they produce. They can
receive values and change handlers directly by props.

<Examples.BaseFieldComponents />

## Feature fields

Feature fields build on top of base field components and provide standard
props for simplified form implementations.

<Examples.FeatureFields />

## Layout components

Wrapping inputs in layout components provide the standard design without
the need for local styles.

<Examples.LayoutComponents />

## Visibility based on data

Certain fields are displayed based on specific data requirements.

<Examples.VisibilityBasedOnData />

## Validation

Here are some examples of validation properties of field components.

<Examples.Validation />

## Using [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/)

Wrapping fields with a [Form.Handler](/uilib/extensions/forms/Form/Handler/) component lets them read and
write data to one common data set, and have input and output of data in
one place instead of connecting to every single field component.

## Using [Wizard](/uilib/extensions/forms/Wizard/Cotainer)
