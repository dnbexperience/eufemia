## Quick start

Field components can be used directly as they are, for example `Field.Email`:

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'

render(<Field.Email />)
```

**NB:** In the above example, only the email field will be a part of your application bundle. Unused code will be tree-shaken away.

Heres how you can import the `Form` and `Field` components:

```jsx
import { Form, Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
```

And here is how you can use the `Form` component:

<Examples.QuickStart />
