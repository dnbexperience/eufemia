# useField

## Description

The `useField` hook standardize handling of the value flow for a single field. It holds error state, hides it while the field is in focus, connects to surrounding `DataContext` (if present) and other things that all field components needs to do. By implementing custom field components and passing the received props (extending `FieldProps`) through `useField`, all these features work the same way as other field components, and you only need to implement the specific unique features of that field.
