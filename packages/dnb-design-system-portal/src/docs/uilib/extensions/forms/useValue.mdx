# useValue

## Description

The `useValue` hook standardize handling of the value flow for a single value. It connects to surrounding `DataContext` (if present) and other things that all value components needs to do. By implementing custom vlaue components and passing the received props (extending `ValueProps`) through `useValue`, all these features work the same way as other value components, and you only need to implement the specific unique features of that component.
