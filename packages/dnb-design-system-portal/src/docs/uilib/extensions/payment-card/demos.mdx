### Custom card using customCard

While the preffered way to use this component is using the product code, you can also define your own style. The most practical way of doing this is to start with one of the default designs exposed through the object `Designs`, and modifying this until you get what you want.

```ts
import PaymentCard, { Designs } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/PaymentCard'
```

The default for the gold card design is with a white Visa logo, here we overwrite it to the mastercard logo instead.

Providing a custom class in the `customData` object can controll atributes like background color and color witch is not supported otherwise.
