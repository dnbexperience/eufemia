# Getting Started

There are several ways to get started depending on what you want to do.

Do you want to...

- simply use the HTML Elements right away?
- customize the core DNB brand style and behavior?
- use the basis and create theme on top?
- make changes to the overall `ui-lib`?
- change contents of the Eufemia Design System Portal (website)?

## So, how do I get started?

You can [follow an intro](/uilib/intro), guiding you through all the elementary parts of Eufemia.

And for sure, check out the code in the [**Demo Apps**](/uilib/getting-started/demos)

<div align="center" className="dnb-section dnb-section--spacing dnb-section--mint-green">
  <Button href="/uilib/intro" size="large" text="Quick Intro" />
</div>
