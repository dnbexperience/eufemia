# Demo Apps

The purpose of having Eufemia Demos is that you as a developer can see the code and understand Eufemia and be inspired - and not least, give you a good start.

## Form Demo #1

The [code](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia-demo/blob/main/src/form-demos/form-demo-01.js) for this little demo app is to show how to make a form layout with Eufemia. It is mainly to demonstrate the visual part, but includes also some event handling - but no state management.

<Button href="/uilib/demos/eufemia-demo/form-demo-01" target="_blank" text="View Demo" variant="secondary" className="margin-bottom" />

<div class="example-box center margin-bottom">
