# Demo Apps

The purpose of having Eufemia Demos is that You as a developer can see the code and understand Eufemia and be inspired - and not least, give You a good start.

## Form Demo #1

The [code](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia-demo/blob/master/src/pages/form-demo-01.js) for this little demo app is to show how to make a form layout with Eufemia. It is mainly to demonstrate the visual part, but includes also some event handling - but no state management.
