# Requirements checklist

## Usage only

### To use the components

There are no specific technical requirements only that it is highly recommended to use a compiling process with proper tree shaking in place.

This library can be used on top of modern JavaScript frontend libraries like React or a framework like Vue.js.

### To use the styles

This library works perfectly together with any styling techniques, like **Styled Components** ([Emotion](https://emotion.sh)), CSS Modules or SASS/LESS. You simply consume **ready to use CSS files**.
