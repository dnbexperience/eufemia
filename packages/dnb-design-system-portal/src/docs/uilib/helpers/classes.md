## CSS helper classes

Reusing classes in the markup instead of using SCSS extends or _mixins_ will prevent duplication in the `dnb-ui-lib`. So also your application will have good benefits from reusing these helper classes.

| Selector                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dnb-core-style`           | In order to be able to have the core Body Style inside a wrapper and available for all its children. The Body Style contains among others stlyes, both the correct line-height and a CSS reset.                                                        |
| `dnb-tab-focus`            | Removes default focus outline from a focusable element and adds a custom visual focus state when is focused by a tab key. There is also: `dnb-mouse-focus`, `dnb-focus-ring` and `dnb-no-focus`                                                        |
| `dnb-skip-link`            | A default Skip Link style. More details in the [Focus Secion](/uilib/usage/accessibility/focus#skip-link)                                                                                                                                              |
| `dnb-spacing`              | Default spacing styles. More details in [Styling](/uilib/usage/customisation/styling#spacing)                                                                                                                                                          |
| `dnb-sr-only`              | Visually hides an element, but is still reachable by screen readers. (_sr_ stands for _Screen Reader_)                                                                                                                                                 |
| `dnb-sr-only--inline`      | Like `dnb-sr-only` - but with flow elements in mind. This enables a set of text (in a paragraph `<p>`) to be enhanced with spans inside `<p>text <span class="dnb-sr-only--inline">sr-only</span> text</p>` without NVDA to split up reading the text. |
| `dnb-drop-shadow`          | Adds the default drop shadow used in the components.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `dnb-responsive-component` | Makes some component form components, like [Input](/uilib/components/input) react to mobile sized screens. But as this can have some negative effects to have this enabled by default, you can enable this optionally using this helper class.         |
| `dnb-unstyled-list`        | Removes default styling for lists. Applies to the `ul` or `ol` elements                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `dnb-hide-on-mobile`       | Hides element on screens that are below the `medium` size. This value of `medium` can be found in `css/core/utilities.scss`                                                                                                                            |
| `dnb-mobile-exclusive`     | The opposite of `dnb-hide-on-mobile`, which means it will only be visible on screens up to the size of `medium                                                                                                                                         |     | `dnb-width-limit` | Our main wrapping class for containers. It has a max-width and a left and right padding which varies based on screen sizes |
| `dnb-belt`                 | A wrapping class which adds a background color and padding to top and bottom                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `dnb-nudge`                | A visual nudging tool. It has a modifying class which tells the element if it should expand horizontally or vertically. **NB! Use with caution!**                                                                                                      |
| `dnb-selection`            | Applies the DNB selection colors to the selected content. More notes below.                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Selection color

Eufemia uses custom `::selection` colors to enhance the contrast and to play well agains the many green colors.
Every HTML class that starts with the prefix `dnb-` will be effected. In some circumstances you can simply make use of the class `.dnb-selection`.

### More about `dnb-nudge`

It also has a data attribute which takes the amount of nudges. One nudge = `1rem`, two nudges = `3rem`. It takes up to `10 nudges`. See example for usage.

### HTML class naming

To ensure a consistent class structure and to ensure that the class is owned by the DNB UI Library, all classes in the UI Library are prefixed with `dnb-`. Read more about that in the [Naming conventions](/uilib/development/naming).

### SASS and mixins

All CSS helper classes are to be found in `src/style/core/helper-classes/helper-classes.scss`
Most helper classes are SCSS _mixins_ which are then applied to the class when invoked.

You can import Eufemia _mixins_ directly into your SCSS styles:

```scss
@import './node_modules/dnb-ui-lib/style/core/utilities.scss';

@include hover {
  @include fakeFocus();
}
```
