## CSS helper classes

Reusing classes in the markup instead of using SCSS extends or _mixins_ will prevent duplication in the `@dnb/eufemia`. So also your application will have good benefits from reusing these helper classes.

## Core style

`dnb-core-style`

In order to be able to have the core Body Style inside a wrapper and available for all its children. The Body Style contains among others styles, the correct color, line-height, font and a CSS reset.

<Examples.CoreStyle />

## Tab focus

`dnb-tab-focus`

Removes default focus outline from a focusable element and adds a custom visual focus state when is focused by a tab key.
There is also:

- `dnb-mouse-focus`
- `dnb-focus-ring`
- `dnb-no-focus`

<Examples.TabFocus />

## Skip link

`dnb-skip-link`

A default Skip Link style, for adding a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area.

<SkipLinkExample />

```html
<body>
  <a class="dnb-skip-link" href="#content-id">Skip to content</a>
  <header>
    <nav>
      <!-- Nav links or content to skip -->
    </nav>
  </header>
  <main id="content-id">
    <!-- Content goes here -->
  </main>
</body>
```

More details in the [Focus Section](/uilib/usage/accessibility/focus#skip-link).

## Spacing

`dnb-spacing`

Sets default spacing (using _margin_) on all HTML elements inside the container with this style. The default spacing is a `margin-bottom: 1.5rem`, but specific margins are defined for headings, lists and tables.

```html
<article class="dnb-spacing">
  <!-- DNB spacings -->
  <h1 class="dnb-h--xx-large">
    e.g. I have now the Eufemia spacing (margin)
  </h1>
  <p class="dnb-p">ðŸ‘‰ Me as well</p>
</article>
```

More details in [Styling](/uilib/usage/customisation/styling#spacing).

## Scrollbar appearance

`dnb-scrollbar-appearance`

Define the DNB scrollbar appearance, including the color `--color-emerald-green` with `transparent`.

NB: Browser support is not fully covered (2021).

## Screen Reader (sr) only

`dnb-sr-only`

Visually hides an element, but is still reachable by screen readers. (_sr_ stands for _Screen Reader_)

<Examples.ScreenReaderOnly />

## Drop shadow

`dnb-drop-shadow`

Adds a default drop shadow, `box-shadow: 0 8px 16px rgba(51, 51, 51, 0.08)`, to the component. The current shadow specification is designed to be less sharp and more blurry.

### CSS properties

The DNB Drop shadow is also available as a CSS Custom Property:

```ts
import properties from '@dnb/eufemia/style/themes/theme-ui/properties.js'

const cssBoxShadow = properties['--shadow-default']
```

If you only want to apply parts of the property, these are available as well:

- `--shadow-default-x: 0;`
- `--shadow-default-y: 8px;`
- `--shadow-default-blur-radius: 16px;`
- `--shadow-default-color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 0.08);`

## Responsive component

`dnb-responsive-component`

Makes some component form components, like [Input](/uilib/components/input) react to small sized screens. But as this can have some negative effects to have this enabled by default, you can enable this optionally using this helper class.

## Unstyled list

`dnb-unstyled-list`

Removes default styling for lists. Applies to the `ul` or `ol` elements.

<Examples.UnstyledList />

## Selection

`dnb-selection`

Applies the DNB selection colors to the selected content.

Eufemia uses custom `::selection` colors to enhance the contrast and to play well against the many green colors.
Every HTML class that starts with the prefix `dnb-` will be effected. In some circumstances you can simply make use of the class `.dnb-selection`, which applies the styles below on `::selection`.

```scss
background-color: var(--color-mint-green);
color: var(--color-black);
text-shadow: none;
```

<Examples.Selection />

## HTML class naming

To ensure a consistent class structure and to ensure that the class is owned by the DNB UI Library, all classes in the UI Library are prefixed with `dnb-`. Read more about that in the [Naming conventions](/contribute/style-guides/naming).
