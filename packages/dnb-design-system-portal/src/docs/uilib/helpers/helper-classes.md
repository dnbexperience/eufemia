## CSS helper classes

Reusing classes in the markup instead of using SCSS extends or _mixins_ will prevent duplication in the `dnb-ui-lib`. So also your application will have good benefits from reusing these helper classes.

| Selector                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `dnb-sr-only`              | Visually hides an element, but is still reachable by screen readers. (_sr_ stands for _Screen Reader_)                                                                                                                                                          |

| `dnb-responsive-component` | Makes some component form components, like [Input](/uilib/components/input) react to mobile sized screens. But as this can have some negative effects to have this enabled by default, you can enable this optionally using this helper class.                  |
| `dnb-unstyled-list`        | Removes default styling for lists. Applies to the `ul` or `ol` elements                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `dnb-belt`                 | A wrapping class which adds a background color and padding to top and bottom                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### More about `dnb-nudge`

It also has a data attribute which takes the amount of nudges. One nudge = `1rem`, two nudges = `3rem`. It takes up to `10 nudges`. See example for usage.

### HTML class naming

To ensure a consistent class structure and to ensure that the class is owned by the DNB UI Library, all classes in the UI Library are prefixed with `dnb-`. Read more about that in the [Naming conventions](/uilib/development/naming).

### SASS and mixins

All CSS helper classes are to be found in `src/style/core/helper-classes.scss`

Most helper classes are SCSS _mixins_ which are then applied to the class when invoked. The helper _mixins_ can be found in `src/style/core/utilities.scss`.

Currently the SASS files are not included in the `dnb-ui-lib`.
