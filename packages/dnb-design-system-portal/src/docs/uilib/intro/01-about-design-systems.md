## What forms the system?

Eufemia as a Design System consist of many sub-systems, like:

- Color systems
- Typography system
- Spacial systems
- Icon system
- Grid system
- Naming system

All of these sub-systems dictates on how components, patterns and styles are build. And documentation, principles and guides of best practices will again tell how to build solutions with good UX.
