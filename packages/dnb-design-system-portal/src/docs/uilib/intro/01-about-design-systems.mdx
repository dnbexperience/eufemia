# Eufemia Design System

> What is a Design System good for?

- Consistent User Experience (**UX**) for all DNB products
- [**Single source of truth**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dnb/eufemia)
- [Contribution](!/contribute) and [collaboration](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia)
- Independent "visual" layer with semantic versioning
- Notification of [new releases](!/uilib/usage#the-eufemia-repository)
- Ready to use sub-systems, tested and easy to integrate

## What forms the system?

Eufemia as a Design System consist of many sub-systems, like:

- Color systems
- Typography system
- Spacial systems
- Icon system
- Grid system
- Naming system

All of these sub-systems dictates on how components, extensions and styles are build. And documentation, principles and guides of best practices will again tell how to build solutions with good UX.
