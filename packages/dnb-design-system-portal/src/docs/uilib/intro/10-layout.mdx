# Layout

To get a good user experience and a professional looking result, perfect layouting is crucial.

- Use the **8 Pixel Grid** everywhere, both on spacing and sizes.
- Use either `em` or `rem` (root em) units for layouts and spacing.
- Use **CSS Flexbox** or **CSS Grid** as layout systems.

## Spacing

Remember, everything should be in the **8px grid** (0.5rem) spacing - even it the designer sometimes are one or two pixels of, you now know what it should be.

But there is also support for basic spacing in every component:
