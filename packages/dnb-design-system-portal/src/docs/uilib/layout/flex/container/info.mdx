## Import

```tsx
import { Flex } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

`Flex.Container` is a building block for [CSS flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) based layout of contents and components.

**NB:** For form layouts, use [Flex.Stack](/uilib/layout/flex/stack/) instead.

You can also use [Flex.Item](/uilib/layout/flex/item) or [Card](/uilib/components/card) for you inner wrappers:

```jsx
import { Flex, Card } from '@dnb/eufemia'

render(
  <Flex.Container>
    <Flex.Item>content</Flex.Item>
    <Card>content</Card>
  </Flex.Container>,
)
```

But you can use it with what ever element too. It will wrap it in an `Flex.Item` to ensure the spacing is applied:

```jsx
import { Flex } from '@dnb/eufemia'

render(
  <Flex.Container>
    <div>content</div>
    <div>content</div>
  </Flex.Container>,
)
```

During render, the items within the "Wrapper" container are wrapped with the same properties. This ensures that all the items have the same appearance.

### Horizontal and Vertical aliases

For shortening the usage of `direction="..."`, you can use:

- `<Flex.Vertical>` instead of `<Flex.Container direction="vertical">`

```jsx
<Flex.Vertical>
  <Flex.Item>part of vertical alignment</Flex.Item>
  <Flex.Item>part of vertical alignment</Flex.Item>
</Flex.Vertical>
```

- `<Flex.Horizontal>` instead of `<Flex.Container direction="horizontal">`

```jsx
<Flex.Horizontal>
  <Flex.Item>part of horizontal alignment</Flex.Item>
  <Flex.Item>part of horizontal alignment</Flex.Item>
</Flex.Horizontal>
```

## Limitations

The `Flex.Container` will iterate over its childrenToReact, but not the children of the children

**NB:** This examples showcases the limitation:

```tsx
import { Flex, Card } from '@dnb/eufemia'

// The Cards will not get the spacing applied
const MyItem = () => (
  <>
    <Card>content</Card>
    <Card>content</Card>
  </>
)

const MyContainer = () => (
  <Flex.Container>
    <MyItem />
  </Flex.Container>
)
```

## How spacing is applied

Nested components should preferably support [spacing properties](/uilib/layout/space/).

When a element or component was given, that does not support spacing, it will still work out of the box as it gets wrapped in a spacing block.

You may else wrap your custom component in a `Flex.Item` – this way, you still can change the spacing per component basis.

Technically, `Flex.Container` checks if a nested component has a property called `_supportsSpacingProps`. So if you have a component that supports the [spacing properties](/uilib/layout/space/), you can add this property `ComponentName._supportsSpacingProps = true`. If you provide `false`, it will not support spacing.

If the component is a wrapper component, and you want its children to support spacing, you can add this property `ComponentName._supportsSpacingProps = 'children'`.

But for simplicity, you can use the HOC `Flex.withChildren`:

```tsx
const Wrapper = Flex.withChildren(({ children }) => {
  return <div>{children}</div>
})

render(
  <Flex.Container direction="vertical">
    <Item />
    <Wrapper>
      <Item />
      <Item />
    </Wrapper>
    <Item />
  </Flex.Container>,
)
```
