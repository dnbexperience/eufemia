## Description

To make it easier to build application layout and [form](/uilib/extensions/forms)-views in line with defined design sketches, there are a number of components for layout.

- **[Flex.Container](/uilib/layout/flex/container)** is a building block for CSS flexbox based layout of contents and components.

  - **`Flex.Vertical`** can be used as an alias instead of the property `direction="vertical"`.
  - **`Flex.Horizontal`** can be used as an alias instead of the property `direction="horizontal"`.

- **[Flex.Item](/uilib/layout/flex/item)** is a building block for CSS flexbox based layout of contents and components.

- **[Flex.Stack](/uilib/layout/flex/stack)** is an outer block element for wrapping content to get the correct layout and spacing between region and region headings.

```jsx
import { Flex } from '@dnb/eufemia'

render(
  <Flex.Container>
    <Flex.Item>content</Flex.Item>
  </Flex.Container>,
)
```
