## Import

```tsx
import { Flex } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

## Description

To make it easier to build application layout and [form](/uilib/extensions/forms)-views in line with defined design sketches, there are a number of components for layout.

- **[Flex.Container](/uilib/layout/flex/container)** is a building block for CSS flexbox based layout of contents and components.

  - **`Flex.Vertical`** can be used as an alias instead of the property `direction="vertical"`.
  - **`Flex.Horizontal`** can be used as an alias instead of the property `direction="horizontal"`.

- **[Flex.Item](/uilib/layout/flex/item)** is a building block for CSS flexbox based layout of contents and components.

- **[Flex.Stack](/uilib/layout/flex/stack)** is an outer block element that wraps content to ensure proper layout and spacing between form elements, larger regions and headings. It stretches its content horizontally (100%).

```jsx
import { Form } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
import { Flex } from '@dnb/eufemia'

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <Form.Handler>
      <Flex.Stack>
        <Form.MainHeading>Main heading</Form.MainHeading>
        <Form.Card>...</Form.Card>
      </Flex.Stack>
    </Form.Handler>
  )
}
```
