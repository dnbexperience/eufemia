## Import

```tsx
import { Flex } from '@dnb/eufemia'
render(<Flex.Stack />)
```

## Description

`Flex.Stack` is an outer block element that wraps content to ensure proper layout and spacing between form elements, larger regions and headings.

It stretches its content horizontally (100%).

It uses [Flex.Container](/uilib/layout/flex/container) under the hood.

## Accessibility

It uses a `section` element. Which allows you to add an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to provide screen readers with landmarks.
