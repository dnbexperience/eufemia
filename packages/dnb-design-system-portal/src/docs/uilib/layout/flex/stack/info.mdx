## Description

`Flex.Stack` is an outer block element for wrapping content to get the correct layout and spacing between region and region headings.

It uses [Flex.Container](/uilib/layout/flex/container) under the hood.

## Accessibility

It uses a `section` element. Which allows you to add an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to provide screen readers with landmarks.
