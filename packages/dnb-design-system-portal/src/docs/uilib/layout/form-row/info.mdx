## Description

The FormRow component is a helper to more easily achieve often used DNB form layout setups.

<DepreciationInfo />

### Fieldset and Legend

By default a `FormRow` is using the `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` HTML elements - if a label property is provided.

## Layout direction

The default direction is `horizontal`.
You can combine several FormRow's (example below) and the direction to achieve the wanted UX layout. You can also send the layout properties along from a [FormSet](/uilib/layout/form-set) (example below).
There are three possible layout properties for the FormRow children:

- `label_direction` Children's label direction
- `direction` Children components direction
- `vertical` Forces both to be vertically

### The property: **`label_direction`**

<FormRowLabelDirectionInfo />

### The property: **`direction`**

<FormRowDirectionInfo />

### The property: **`vertical`**

<FormRowVerticalInfo />

### Default

This is how it looks if you don't make any definitions.

<FormRowDefaultInfo />

## Spacing

To give a FormRow space, properties from [Space](/uilib/layout/space/properties) are supported:

<FormRowSpacingInfo />

## Provider

You can send down the `FormRow` as an application-wide property (Context). More info about the [provider usage](/uilib/layout/form-row/provider).

## Responsiveness

The FormRow component provides by default responsiveness.
But if you also want the form components to be responsive. E.g. the label of the input should be wrapped to be vertical / above the input, then you have to set the `responsive` prop to `true`.

<FormRowResponsiveInfo />

Wrapping happens then if the viewport (screen) is less than `max-width: 40em`.

You can also make use of the [helper class](/uilib/helpers), e.g. `<FormRow className="dnb-responsive-component">...</FormRow>`.
