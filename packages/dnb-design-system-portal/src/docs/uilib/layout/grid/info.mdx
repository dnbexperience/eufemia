## Description

To make it easier to build responsive application layouts in line with defined design sketches, there are a number of components for layout.

- **[Grid.Container](/uilib/layout/grid/container)** is a layout system for CSS grid based layout of contents.

- **[Grid.Item](/uilib/layout/grid/item)** is a layout system for CSS grid based layout of contents.

```jsx
import { Grid } from '@dnb/eufemia'

render(
  <Grid.Container>
    <Grid.Item span={[1, 6]}>Item A</Grid.Item>
    <Grid.Item span={[7, 12]}>Item B</Grid.Item>
  </Grid.Container>,
)
```

You can find more related information in the [Layout](/uilib/layout) pages.

## Columns

UX designers are using a 12 column system, along with a 4 and 6 column system, during their design processes.

Here is an [example](/uilib/layout/grid/visual-tests/page-layout/) of how to use this Grid component for a page layout.
