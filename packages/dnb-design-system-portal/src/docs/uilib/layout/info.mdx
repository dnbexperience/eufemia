## Description

To make it easier to build application layout and [form](/uilib/extensions/forms)-views in line with defined design sketches, there are a number of components for layout.

- **[Spacing](/uilib/layout/spacing)** table and information.

- **[Media Queries](/uilib/layout/media-queries)** and breakpoints table and information.

- **[Flex](/uilib/layout/flex)** is a building block for CSS flexbox based layout of contents, components and [forms](/uilib/extensions/forms).

- **[Grid](/uilib/layout/grid)** is a layout system for CSS grid based layout of contents.

- **[Space](/uilib/layout/space)** is a component that provides `margins` within the [provided spacing patterns](/uilib/usage/layout/spacing#spacing-helpers).

## Deprecated layout components

- **[FormSet](/uilib/layout/form-set)** is deprecated. Use [Flex](/uilib/layout/flex), the [Forms](/uilib/extensions/forms) extension and the Eufemia [Provider](/uilib/usage/customisation/provider-info) as an replacement.

- **[FormRow](/uilib/layout/form-row)** is deprecated. Use [Flex](/uilib/layout/flex) and the [Forms](/uilib/extensions/forms) extension as an replacement.

## Units and responsiveness

Please â€“ use `rem` instead of `px` for all of your custom CSS, and make sure;

- you always use the nearest half `rem` value, like _0.5rem_, _1rem_ or _1.5rem_ and so forth.
- you always get a **total computed height** within the grid.

This results in maintaining the integrity of the **8px** base grid.

### Exceptions

There are exceptions for when you define a "minimum" of an area, such as `min-width`. Because it will increase in size when a larger browser font-size is used. In that case, user `px` as your sizing unit.

### Smaller Units

Sometimes you may need a compensation of only a few pixels. Heres how to calculate the correct _rem_ values:

- 1px = `1/16x1` = **0.0625rem**
- 2px = `1/16x2` = **0.125rem**
- And so on ...

## Columns

UX designers are using a 12 column system, along with a 4 and 6 column system, during their design processes.

### What are the differences between Flex and Grid?

Both to support different sizing of items on different media breakpoints.

**Flex**

Uses CSS `flexbox`.

- Best suited for Forms layout.
- Can either stack vertically or horizontally.
- Can be used with any kind of children.
- Even distribution of space.
- Keeps order of items like they where given in the DOM structure.
- Items can be sized in percentage.
- When a size (percentage) is given, they stack horizontally.

```jsx
import { Flex } from '@dnb/eufemia'
render(
  <Flex.Container>
    <Flex.Item>content</Flex.Item>
    <OtherComponent>content</OtherComponent>
  </Flex.Container>,
)
```

**Grid**

Uses CSS `grid`.

- Best suited for applications with a column based layout.
- Columns do change between 4, 6 and 12 on the given size (media query) of the browser or screen size.
- The Grid.Container depends on Grid.Item.
- Items do span from column "a" to "b".
- Items can have different order in opposition from what's given in the DOM structure.

```jsx
import { Grid } from '@dnb/eufemia'

render(
  <Grid.Container>
    <Grid.Item>content</Grid.Item>
    <Grid.Item>content</Grid.Item>
  </Grid.Container>,
)
```
