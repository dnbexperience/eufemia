# Usage

**Get started using the DNB user interface library**

The UI Library HTML Elements and UI Components are isolated, ready-to-use elements. They are self-supporting, and will use the styles they need to display.

- **HTML Elements** are styled HTML tags
- **UI Components** are styled and custom build HTML elements
- **UI Patterns** are a way to demonstrate how a set of components and elements could work together

You can use any of the HTML Elements and UI Components as demonstrated in the documentation with a variety of customization properties.

## Installation

To install and save the `dnb-ui-lib` in your **package.json** dependencies, run:

_NB!_ [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) and [React-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) are needed as well.

```bash
# at time of writing, React version 16 was used
# so consider to run react@16 and react-dom@16
$ npm i dnb-ui-lib react react-dom
```
