# Usage

**Get started using the DNB user interface library**

The UI Library HTML Elements and UI Components are isolated, ready-to-use elements. They are self-supporting, and will use the styles they need to display.

- **HTML Elements** are styled HTML tags
- **UI Components** are styled and custom build HTML elements
- **UI Patterns** are a way to demonstrate how a set of components and elements could work together

You can use any of the HTML Elements and UI Components as demonstrated in the documentation with a variety of customization properties.
