# Usage

**Get started using the DNB user interface library**

The UI library's HTML elements and UI components are isolated, ready-to-use building blocks. They are self-contained and include the styles needed for proper display.

- **HTML elements** are styled HTML tags
- **UI components** are styled and custom-built HTML elements
- **UI extensions** are styled, functional additions to Eufemia

You can use any of the HTML elements and UI components as demonstrated in the documentation, with various customization properties available.

## Installation

To install and save `@dnb/eufemia` in your **package.json** dependencies, run:

**Note:** [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) and [React DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) are also required.

```bash
# React version 16 is currently used
# You may want to specify react@16 and react-dom@16

### Configuration and Browserslist

Eufemia uses the [@dnb/browserslist-config](https://github.com/dnbexperience/browserslist-config) configuration for bundle output, defined in `.browserslistrc`:

- `extends @dnb/browserslist-config`

This configuration only affects the JavaScript bundle output, not the CSS bundle output.

To see which browsers this config supports, paste the following config into the [Check compatible browsers](https://browsersl.ist/#q=defaults+and+supports+es6-module) tool:

<SupportedBrowsersConfig />
