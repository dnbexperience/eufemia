# Usage

**Get started using the DNB user interface library**

The UI Library HTML Elements and UI Components are isolated, ready-to-use elements. They are self-supporting, and will use the styles they need to display.

- **HTML Elements** are styled HTML tags
- **UI Components** are styled and custom-built HTML elements
- **UI Extensions** are styled and functional, but related additions to Eufemia

You can use any of the HTML Elements and UI Components as demonstrated in the documentation with a variety of customization properties.

## Installation

To install and save the `@dnb/eufemia` in your **package.json** dependencies, run:

_NB!_ [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) and [React-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) are needed as well.

```bash
# at time of writing, React version 16 was used
# so consider to run react@16 and react-dom@16

```

## Supported Browsers and Platforms

To cover most users in Norway and balance between security and user experience, DNB has defined browsers support list:

| Device type   | OS          | Browsers |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| Desktop       | -           | Chrome >= 109 <br /> Edge >= 109 <br /> Firefox >= 115 <br /> Opera >= 95 <br /> Safari >= 13.1 |
| Tablet/Mobile | Android >=6 | Chrome >= 106 <br /> Firefox >= 115 <br /> Samsung Browser >=17 |
|               | iOS >= 13.1 | Safari iOS >=13.1 |

Based on it, Eufemia is offering shared browserslist config `@dnb/browserslist-config`. See [Readme](https://github.com/dnbexperience/browserslist-config) to get more information about how to use it.
