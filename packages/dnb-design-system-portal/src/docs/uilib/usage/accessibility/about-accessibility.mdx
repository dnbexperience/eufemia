## Eufemia aims to be [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) compliant

HTML elements are by default good at accessibility. Eufemia components and its building blocks are also made to include all the needed features to make them accessible.

## WCAG 2.1 and Universal design (UU)

[From year 2021](https://www.uutilsynet.no/webdirektivet-wad/eus-webdirektiv-wad/265), all new and existing web solutions has to follow [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

On _uutilsynet.no_ you can find an easy to read [WCAG guide (Norwegian)](https://www.uutilsynet.no/wcag-standarden/wcag-20-standarden/86).

## Main focus

You as a developer has the responsibility to have the technical knowledge about accessibility. You have to implement and use best practices to make applications accessible for every user. We talk about all kinds of users, people who have temporary or permanent disabilities, so they depend on what you put into the application - as code. Therefore, you have to:

- Test **keyboard navigation** during development <Icon icon={CheckIcon} aria-hidden />
- Test with **screen readers** during development <Icon icon={CheckIcon} aria-hidden />
- Test with **200%** in `font-size` during development <Icon icon={CheckIcon} aria-hidden />
- Test page at **320px** screen width during development <Icon icon={CheckIcon} aria-hidden />

## Keyboard users

Should be able to navigate the application by their keyboard only. For those it is extremely important that [active focus management](/uilib/usage/accessibility/focus) is done right and has the required [focus ring](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#navigation-mechanisms-focus-visible) in place.

> [**2.1.1 Keyboard:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#keyboard) All functionality of the content is _operable through a keyboard_ interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints.

### Your responsibility

You as a developer has to make sure your application supports keyboard navigation. This will also make your application more assistive technology and screen friendly.

The `@dnb/eufemia` and it's building blocks are supporting keyboard usage.

Read more about [focus management and the helper tools](!/uilib/usage/accessibility/focus).

## Screen reader users

Should be able to use the most common used screen readers like VoiceOver (Apple devices) and NVDA or JAWS on Windows. Read more about [screen readers](!/uilib/usage/accessibility/screenreader).

> [**4.1 Compatible:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#compatible) Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, _including assistive technologies_.

### Your responsibility

Good keyboard support is crucial to make web application accessible on for assistive technologies. So - [think landmark and semantics first](!/uilib/usage/accessibility#landmark--and-semantics-example). This includes also [typography](!/uilib/usage/best-practices/for-typography#think-semantics-first) and best practices for [images and illustrations](!/uilib/usage/accessibility/screenreader).

## **200%** in `font-size` \{#font-size\}

The [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) document is describing it clearly:

> [**1.4.4 Resize text:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#resize-text) Text can be resized without assistive technology _up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality_.<br /><br /> [**1.4.8 Visual Presentation:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#visual-presentation) Text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent in a way that _does not require the user to scroll horizontally_ to read a line of text.

### Your responsibility

This means; every application **has to be made responsive**. Even if the application lives in a static sized container (960px). Use your browser or system settings to change the `font-size` for testing purposes.

Read [more about responsive layouts](!/uilib/usage/layout#units).

The `@dnb/eufemia` and its building blocks are build from ground up to support font-size adaption automatically.

## 320px screen width minimum

This is to ensure that users with visual limitations can sufficiently zoom the page even on a medium sized monitor. It's equivalent to 400% zoom in a 1280px viewport.

> [**1.4.10 Reflow:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#reflow) Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for: Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels

Make sure that you take in to consideration any paddings that might be added around your content. If the content you are working on will be placed inside a container with 16px padding on each side, you will need to test at 288px (320 - 16 - 16).
