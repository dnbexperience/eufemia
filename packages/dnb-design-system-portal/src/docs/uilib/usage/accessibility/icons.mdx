# Accessibility of Icons

By using inline SVG, we have the possibility to make graphical assets both **responsive** and **interactive**. In order to do so, use the [Icon](/uilib/components/icon) component. These components provide the needed runtime processing.

## Decorative Icons

The Icon component uses `role="decoration"` by default, which makes it invisible to assistive technologies.

## Responsive Icons

Use `size="auto"` to force the icon to inherit the size of its parent element.

## SVG Icons

_Scalable Vector Graphics_ can be set up to be scalable and actually respond to the `font-size`.
