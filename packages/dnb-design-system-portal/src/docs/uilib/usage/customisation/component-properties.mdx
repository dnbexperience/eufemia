# Component Properties

Every [Component](/uilib/components) has its own `properties` to make them work for a variety of cases. You may have a look at the table describing all the possibilities. Check out for example the [Button Properties](/uilib/components/button/properties).

## Naming

Both the properties- and event names should use **camelCase** to support a universal [naming convention](/contribute/style-guides/naming).

## Large Buttons & Icons

Below are some examples. You can even modify them right away in the Browser.
