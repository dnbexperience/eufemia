# Importing the CSS

To include the packages `dnb-ui-core`, `ui-theme-basis` and `ui-theme-components` in a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) based environment (given you have a CSS loader in place), do this:

```js
// This includes the `dnb-ui-core`, `ui-theme-components` and`ui-theme-basis`
import '@dnb/eufemia/style'
```

## Select a theme

The above import is a shorthand for the DNB main theme. It is equivalent to the following import:

```js
// This is identical to `import '@dnb/eufemia/style'`
import '@dnb/eufemia/style/core'
import '@dnb/eufemia/style/themes/ui'
```

To import another theme, replace the second import:

```js
// This is imports the sbanken theme instead
import '@dnb/eufemia/style/core'
import '@dnb/eufemia/style/themes/sbanken'
```

## Gatsby Plugin

The [gatsby-plugin-eufemia-theme-handler](https://github.com/dnbexperience/gatsby-plugin-eufemia-theme-handler) plugin makes it easy to add the needed styles and provides also a runtime style switch mechanism.

## Importing styles from within CSS

```css
@import url('@dnb/eufemia/style/dnb-ui-core.css');
@import url('@dnb/eufemia/style/themes/theme-ui/ui-theme-components.css');
@import url('@dnb/eufemia/style/themes/theme-ui/ui-theme-basis.css');
```

## Legacy import

The legacy import `import '@dnb/eufemia/style/basis'` scopes global css so it does not affect the whole page. But requires that
you place a wrapper element with class `.dnb-core-style` around all Eufemia elements. And may causes some css specificity issues.

If possible, it should be replaced with `import '@dnb/eufemia/style/core'` that attaches the same css to the `body` tag instead.

```js
import '@dnb/eufemia/style/basis' // replaced by '@dnb/eufemia/style/core'
import '@dnb/eufemia/style/themes/ui'
```

## Single Component only

It is possible to import a single CSS Style of a single component at once:

```js
// Imports the core css for the theme
import '@dnb/eufemia/style/core'
import '@dnb/eufemia/style/themes/ui/basis'

// Imports only the Button CSS and Main DNB Theme
import '@dnb/eufemia/components/button/style'
import '@dnb/eufemia/components/button/style/themes/ui'
```
