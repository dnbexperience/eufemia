# Theming

Read the [Styling examples](/uilib/usage/customisation/styling) on how to include styles and a theme.
This section is about how theming works and how to actually create a custom theme.

## How Themes are built

By default, all the HTML Elements (components) are built by separating the "visual styling" parts from the "functional layout" parts. This way we can create new custom visual styles.

Of course, we can still overwrite the functional layout properties to customize our theme even further.

The included themes are built using SASS. Simply because we can reuse the _@mixin_'s and variables from SASS.

We have the **Main Theming File**, which is located here: `dnb-ui-lib/src/style/themes/dnb-theme-[THEME].scss`

From here, we "can" reuse some default theming mechanism, just to have a fallback:

```scss
@import '../theme-ui/dnb-theme-ui.scss';
```

All the additional sub theming files (for every component) are automatically added to the **Main Theming File** by running `$ yarn build`. More on that further down.

If we need a custom theming file for one or more components, we can do so by creating `dnb-ui-lib/src/components/[COMPONENT]/style/dnb-button-theme-[THEME].scss`.

## Local Theming setup

There are several solutions to **create a new theme**.
One of which is by using the [linking feature of Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/link/).

### _Method:_ yarn link and SASS

Make sure Your project can handle **\*.scss** files.

**1.** make a copy of the [repository](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia). Place it somewhere locally on your machine

**2.** change your command line (Terminal) directory to the sub package `dnb-ui-lib` (_eufemia/packages/dnb-ui-lib_)

**3.** make the package ready for development by running:

```bash
$ yarn install && yarn build && yarn link
```

**4.** on your application root directory, run:

```bash
$ yarn link "dnb-ui-lib"
```

**5.** That's it. Now you can use (import/require) the NPM module in your application like:

```js
import { Button } from 'dnb-ui-lib/components'
import 'dnb-ui-lib/style/components'

// See the "src" in the path?
import 'dnb-ui-lib/src/style/themes/dnb-theme-[MY THEME].scss'
```

**6.** Don't forget to add `"dnb-ui-lib": "*"` with the respective version (alongside React) to your dependencies:

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "dnb-ui-lib": "*",
    "react": "^16",
    "react-dom": "^16",
    ...
  }
```

**7.** _Note:_ Every time you create a new theme file, you have to run `yarn build` again. This way the new theme file gets added/bundled to the **Main Theming File**.
