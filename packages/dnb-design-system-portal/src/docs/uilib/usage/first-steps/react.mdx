# React JS for the web

The most basic way to use the `@dnb/eufemia` is like this:

## Basic Buttons

<BasicButtonsExample />

### Importing the Components

To make the [Button](/uilib/components/button) component work, we have to import it as well:

```js
import { Button } from '@dnb/eufemia'
```

And here an example with several imports:

```js
import { Button, Icon } from '@dnb/eufemia/components'
import { H1, P, Link } from '@dnb/eufemia'
import { hamburger as hamburgerIcon } from '@dnb/eufemia/icons'
```

### Events

<EventsExample />

Now, let's jump to the [Button Docs](/uilib/components/button) for more details.

## Examples

Have a look at the [Webpack example app](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia-examples/tree/main/packages/example-react) and [SSR example](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia-examples/tree/main/packages/example-ssr).
