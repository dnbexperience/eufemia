# Layout

You may use the Eufemia [Layout](/uilib/components/layout/) component for your application layouts and [form](/uilib/extensions/forms)-views.

Or you may just use **CSS Flexbox** or **CSS Grid**. But please, do not use third-party layout libraries.

It is your responsibility to ensure 100% consistency and compatibility.

## Grid

UX designers are using a 12 column system, along with a 4 and 6 column system, during their design processes.

There are plans to implement support for this in the future.

## Responsiveness

In short, only use `rem` for layouts and spacing and make sure ...

- you always use the nearest half `rem` value, like _0.5rem_, _1rem_ or _1.5rem_ and so forth.
- you always get a **total computed height** within the grid.

This results in maintaining the integrity of the **8px** base grid.

### Smaller Units

Sometimes you may need a compensation of only a few pixels. Heres how to calculate the correct _rem_ values:

- 1px = `1/16x1` = **0.0625rem**
- 2px = `1/16x2` = **0.125rem**
- And so on ...
