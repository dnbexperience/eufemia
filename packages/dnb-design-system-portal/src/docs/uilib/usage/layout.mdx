# Layout

To not overcomplicate the Eufemia - and limit the creativity and possibilities, the DNB UX team has decided to not force the usage of a dedicated layout system. This opens up for more freedom in designing and building interface layouts.

## Responsiveness

In short, only use `rem` for layouts and spacing and make sure ...

- you always use the nearest half `rem` value, like _0.5rem_, _1rem_ or _1.5rem_ and so forth.
- you always get a **total computed height** within the grid.

This results in maintaining the integrity of the **8px** base grid.

### Smaller Units

Sometimes you may need a compensation of only a few pixels. Heres how to calculate the correct _rem_ values:

- 1px = `1/16x1` = **0.0625rem**
- 2px = `1/16x2` = **0.125rem**
- And so on ...

## Layout system

If you are working together with an DNB UX Designer, you can decide freely what layout mechanism you want to use. For web applications use **CSS Flexbox** or **CSS Grid**. But it is your responsibility to ensure 100% consistency and compatibility.
