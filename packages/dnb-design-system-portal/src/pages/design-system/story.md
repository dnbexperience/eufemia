# The Story of Eufemia

Once appon a time, back to the 14th century, Queen Eufemia lived at Rügen. It was then agreed that She has to be married with Håkon Magnusson. She was then sent to a very falsified area, called Bjørvika.
What gave her courage, was her books. She brought her library with her, which was one of Europe's largest at that time.

So it is **Queen Eufemia's library** that gave the DNB Design System the name.
