# Primary Icons

The Primary Icons are included in the [UI Library](/uilib) and also shipped bundled as an [UMD Package](https://unpkg.com/dnb-ui-lib@latest/umd/dnb-ui-lib-icons.min.js).

Primary Icons can easily be included, for instance, in [Buttons](/uilib/components/button). They are integrated by using the `<IconPrimary />` Component.
