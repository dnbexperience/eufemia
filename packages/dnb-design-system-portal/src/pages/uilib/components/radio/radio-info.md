## Description

The `Radio` component is shown as a circle that is filled (checked) when activated.
Radioes are used to let a user select one option / value of a limited number of choices.

It is recommended to use it in a group. You can use either the React component `<Radio.Group>` or use the property `group="NAME"` to define the group.
