## Missing HTML Elements

Several commonly used HTML Elements are not included in the `dnb-ui-lib`. This decision is made by the DNB UX Team and relies on a principle to make UX design as good as possible, consistent and more thoughtful towards a broader customer target.

- For the `select` element, use e.g. [**Dropdown**](/uilib/components/dropdown) or [**Accordion**](/uilib/components/accordion) component.

- For `checkbox` or `radio` inputs, use e.g. [**Toggle Button**](/uilib/components/button) or [**Switch**](/uilib/components/switch) component.
