# Getting Started

There are several ways to get started depending on what you want to do.

Do you want to...

- simply use the HTML Elements right away?
- customize the core DNB brand style and behavior?
- create a new global theme?
- make changes to the overall `ui-lib`?
- change texts and content of the Eufemia Design System Portal (website)?
