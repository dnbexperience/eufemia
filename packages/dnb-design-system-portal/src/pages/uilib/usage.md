# Usage

**Get started using the DNB User Interface Library**

The UI Library HTML Elements are isolated, ready-to-use elements. They are self-supporting, and will use the styles they need to display.

You can use any of the HTML Elements as demonstrated in the documentation. Please refer to the demo pages to see [how they should be used](/uilib/components).

## Installation

To install and save the `dnb-ui-lib` in your **package.json** dependencies, run:

_NB!_ [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) and [React-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) are needed as well.

```bash
# at time of writing, React version 16 was used
# so consider to run react@16 and react-dom@16
$ yarn add dnb-ui-lib react react-dom
```
