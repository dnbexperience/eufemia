# Typography

## Headings and styling

Never use Headings (like `<h4>`) for only styling purposes. Headings exist in first place to practice correct semantics, witch again will gain all kind of users.

Use headings where You think that someone with a Screen Reader would have benefits of finding and reading a title.

## H1

Always, yes, always have only one `h1` on a side. Have it where it makes most sense of what content is about.
