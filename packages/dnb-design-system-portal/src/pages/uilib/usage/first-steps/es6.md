# ES6

In some cases you may want to import an ES6 version. Make sure your environment has a build process with:

- tree shaking
- compiling down to ES5
- minification

in place.

```js
// ES6 version of all Components
import 'dnb-ui-lib/es/components'

// ES6 version of a single component
import 'dnb-ui-lib/es/components/button'
```
