## Description

The main icon component is basically a wrapper for what ever icon you place within it. This means a `span` wrapping an inline `svg`.

There is also the [Primary Icon](/uilib/components/icon-primary/) which comes with all the [Primary Icons](/icons/primary) included.

### More details

To make it clear that all the "most common" icons are loaded at once, we have an additional icon component, named `IconPrimary` or `dnb-icon-primary`.
