## Description

The input component is an umbrella component for all inputs which share the same style as the classic `text` input field. Radio buttons and other form elements are not included here.

There is an experimental [Masked-Input component](/uilib/components/input-masked/)

The **id** property is mandatory because of its importance in the DOM - whether it's as a reference for the label or as a hook when submitting a form.
