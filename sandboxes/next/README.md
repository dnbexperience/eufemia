# Getting Started

First, build a local bundle of the Eufemia library in order to get components that have the `use client` directive embedded:

```bash
yarn workspace @dnb/eufemia build
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn workspace next dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
