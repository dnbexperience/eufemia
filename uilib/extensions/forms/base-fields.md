# Base fields

Base fields are data driven fields you choose depending on the type of input. You can use these directly in your application forms.

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.String label="Name" />)
```

Here is also a list of [all available fields](/uilib/extensions/forms/all-fields/).
