# Feature fields

Feature fields are fields with data-specific functionality built on top of base [field components](/uilib/extensions/forms/base-fields/).

```jsx
import { Field } from '@dnb/eufemia/extensions/forms'
render(<Field.Email />)
```

Here is also a list of [all available fields](/uilib/extensions/forms/all-fields/).
